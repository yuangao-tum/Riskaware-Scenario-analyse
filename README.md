## Abstract:
Large Language Models (LLMs) can capture
nuanced contextual relationships, reasoning, and complex
problem-solving. By leveraging their ability to process
and interpret large-scale information, LLMs have shown
potential to address domain-specific challenges, including
those in autonomous driving systems. This paper proposes
a novel framework that leverages LLMs for risk-aware
analysis of generated driving scenarios. We hypothesize that
LLMs can effectively evaluate whether driving scenarios
generated by autonomous driving testing simulators are
safety-critical. To validate this hypothesis, we conducted an
empirical evaluation to assess the effectiveness of LLMs
in performing this task. This framework will also provide
feedback to generate the new safety-critical scenario by
using adversarial method to modify existing non-critical
scenarios and test their effectiveness in validating motion
planning algorithms.
