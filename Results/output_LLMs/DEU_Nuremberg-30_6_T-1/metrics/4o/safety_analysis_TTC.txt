Safety analysis for timestep 5.4 seconds:
```plaintext
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 30601
    - Relative Direction: Left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0, indicating a longitudinal collision. DTClat is 39.07, indicating negligible lateral risk, but due to the longitudinal collision, risk remains high in the overall scenario.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0  
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5 (since wdominant is 0 for left direction)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0, indicating an immediate longitudinal collision. TTClat is Infinity, indicating negligible lateral risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5 (since wdominant is 0 for left direction)
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 30603
    - Relative Direction: Left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0, indicating a longitudinal collision. DTClat is 10.79, indicating negligible lateral risk, but due to the longitudinal collision, risk remains high in the overall scenario.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0  
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5 (since wdominant is 0 for left direction)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0, indicating an immediate longitudinal collision. TTClat is 62.78, indicating negligible lateral risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5 (since wdominant is 0 for left direction)
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 30604
    - Relative Direction: Right
