Safety analysis for timestep 5.4 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.4: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30601
- Relative Direction: Left
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal DTC is 0.0, indicating a direct collision risk, while lateral DTC of 39.07 implies minimal lateral risk. Thus, the overall risk is primarily driven by the longitudinal distance.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0 
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
- Overall Distance Safety Score: DSC = 0 * 0 + 4 * (1 - 0) = 0
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal TTC is 0.0 indicating an immediate collision risk, while lateral TTC is Infinity indicating no risk from the side movement; hence, the overall risk is determined by longitudinal times.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: TSC = 0 * 0 + 5 * (1 - 0) = 0
- Overall Risk Score: Risk Score = 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 0 = 0

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30603
- Relative Direction: Left
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal DTC is 0.0, indicating a direct collision risk, and lateral DTC of 10.79 indicates reduced but still present lateral risk. Thus, primarily driven by the longitudinal distance.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 2
- Overall Distance Safety Score: DSC = 0 * 0 + 2 * (1 - 0) = 0
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal TTC is 0.0 indicating an immediate collision risk, while lateral TTC of 62.78 indicates no risk from lateral actions; overall risk is determined by longitudinal times.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: TSC = 0 * 0 + 5 * (1 - 0) = 0
- Overall Risk Score: Risk Score = 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 0 = 0

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30604
- Relative Direction: Right
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal DTC is 0.0, indicating a direct collision risk, and lateral DTC of 2.45 indicates significant risk. Thus, the risk is mainly determined by the longitudinal distance.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 2
- Overall Distance Safety Score: DSC = 0 * 0 + 2 * (1 - 0) = 0
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal TTC is 0.0 indicating an immediate collision risk, with a lateral TTC of 0.5 signifying imminent lateral risk; overall risk is driven by longitudinal times.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 1
- Overall Time Safety Score: TSC = 0 * 0 + 1 * (1 - 0) = 0
- Overall Risk Score: Risk Score = 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 0 = 0
