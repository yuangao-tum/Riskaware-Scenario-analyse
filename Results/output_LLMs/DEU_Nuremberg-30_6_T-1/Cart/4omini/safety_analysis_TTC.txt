Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.4 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.4: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

**1. Obstacle ID: 30601.0**  
- **Distance Risk reason**: The distance (MDC) to this obstacle is significant, as it is located at (360.677, -21.6683) while the ego is at (356.6766, -62.3442). The combined position forms a reasonably far lateral distance considering both vehicles’ positions.  
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk) - There is a significant enough distance that suggests it is not an immediate concern for collision.

- **Time Risk reason**: With a velocity of 8.1279, it is moving away from the ego vehicle, resulting in a significant TTC that indicates no imminent risk of collision.  
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk) - The obstacle is moving away from the expected trajectory of the ego vehicle.

- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk) – There is no collision imminent with this obstacle considering both time and distance metrics.

**2. Obstacle ID: 30603.0**  
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is located at (356.6433, -49.9441), very close in the y-direction to the ego position. The lateral difference is minimal.  
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk) - The minimal distance does provide a level of concern, but still allows for a manageable outcome.

- **Time Risk reason**: With a velocity of 0.1719, it is virtually stationary, leading to a relatively safe TTC as the ego vehicle is not in immediate path of encroachment.  
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk) - While its speed is low, its proximity is manageable; still significant minutes of distance can mitigate collision risk.

- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk) – Manageable situation although the distance could bring it to a closer assessment.

**3. Obstacle ID: 30604.0**  
- **Distance Risk reason**: The distance from this obstacle is also significant. It is at (356.7501, -66.4002), suggesting it is in the ego's lanelet but below (in y terms).  
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk) – While it remains in the same lanelet, the lateral distance provides some safety margin.

- **Time Risk reason**: This obstacle has a velocity of 8.1859. Given its position and the ego's stationary condition, there is no immediate risk of collision. With the obstacle moving with a significant speed and the separation increasing, the risk lowers sharply.  
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk) – The obstacle is moving away too fast to pose a danger.

- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk) – No imminent collision associated with this obstacle due to effective metrics.

### Conclusion:
In reviewing the potential collision scenarios defined by the positions and metrics, there seem to be no possessing collision risks at this moment (overall risk score of 0) and no extreme risks being defined (overall risk score of 1). All analyzed obstacles maintained assessment scores of 4, thus estimated risks seem low but manageable. The ego vehicle remains in a relatively safe framework, given its current orientation and velocity.
