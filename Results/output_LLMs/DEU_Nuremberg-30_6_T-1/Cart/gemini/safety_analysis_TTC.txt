Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.4 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30601.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (475) than the ego vehicle (1804), and their lateral positions are significantly different (-21.67 vs. -62.34).  The longitudinal distance is also relatively large. Thus, there is minimal risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Given the different lane assignments and the lateral separation, the TTC is not a significant concern.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30603.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle is in a different lanelet (476) than the ego vehicle (1804), but the longitudinal positions are very close (356.64 vs 356.68). Although the lateral distance is moderate (-49.94 vs. -62.34), the low velocity of the obstacle (0.17 m/s) suggests a low risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The low velocity of the obstacle and its current lateral distance suggest a reasonably high TTC, reducing the immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30604.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet (1804) as the ego vehicle. The longitudinal positions are very close (356.75 vs. 356.68), and the lateral distance is relatively small (-66.40 vs. -62.34).  This proximity represents a potential risk, amplified by the obstacle's velocity (8.18 m/s) moving towards the stationary ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity and proximity suggest a short TTC, making this a high-risk situation requiring immediate action.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2
