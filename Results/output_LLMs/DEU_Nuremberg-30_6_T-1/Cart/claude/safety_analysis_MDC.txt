Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.4 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario and evaluate collision risks:

### Safety Analysis:

1. Obstacle 30603 (Same lanelet 476 as ego):
- Distance Risk reason: Starting at close proximity (~14.7m) in same lanelet and moving in same direction, maintaining consistent but safe longitudinal separation
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low risk due to maintained separation)
- Time Risk reason: Very low relative velocity, vehicles moving in same direction with decreasing speeds
- Time safety score: 4 (Low risk due to controlled deceleration)
- Overall Risk score: 4

2. Obstacle 30601:
- Distance Risk reason: Initially at ~13.6m lateral distance, crosses paths but maintains safe separation
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium risk due to crossing trajectory)
- Time Risk reason: Different directions but controlled intersection crossing
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium risk during crossing)
- Overall Risk score: 3

3. Obstacle 30600:
- Distance Risk reason: Large distance (~52m) with no direct path conflict
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible risk)
- Time Risk reason: No significant collision path
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5

4. Obstacle 30604:
- Distance Risk reason: Initially at safe distance (~47m), no direct conflict
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible risk)
- Time Risk reason: No significant collision path
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Key Observations:
1. No immediate collision risks detected (no score of 0 or 1)
2. Main potential risk is with Obstacle 30603 in same lanelet, but maintains safe distance
3. Ego vehicle shows controlled deceleration to stop
4. All obstacles maintain safe distances and velocities
5. No extreme risk situations identified
