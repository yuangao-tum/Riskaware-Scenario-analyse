Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.4 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.4: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30601.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (475.0) and at a significant lateral offset from the ego vehicle. Despite having a high velocity, its trajectory does not intersect with the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk, based on the substantial lateral and longitudinal separation)
- **Time Risk reason**: With a significant separation and the absence of convergence towards the ego vehicle's path, the TTC (in both longitudinal and lateral directions) suggests no immediate collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30603.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned behind the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet (476.0), it shows minimal forward velocity, indicating low risk of intersecting paths.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low risk due to its proximity but low velocity towards the ego)
- **Time Risk reason**: Given the slow velocity and the position behind the ego vehicle, TTC suggests manageable risk, with little chance of rapid closure.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30604.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is in the same lanelet (1804.0) as the ego vehicle but located behind it. However, it's moving fast towards the ego vehicle, decreasing the separation distance.
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High risk due to same lanelet and approach speed)
- **Time Risk reason**: With a notable velocity towards the ego vehicle and a decently negative acceleration, there is a high probability of closure, anticipated by a shorter TTC.
- **Time safety score**: 2 (High risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

In this scenario, no obstacles are at a collision risk level of 0 or an extreme risk level of 1. Obstacle 30604.0, while high risk, is not at the extreme collision risk level. Consequently, no obstacles meet the criteria for inclusion within the JSON summary.
