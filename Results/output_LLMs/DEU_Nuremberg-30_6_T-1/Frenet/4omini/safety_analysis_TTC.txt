### Safety analysis for timestep 5.4: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30601.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is laterally 39.07 m away, which indicates a significant lateral separation. Although it's moving away, its longitudinal distance is 0.0 m, indicating it is directly in line with the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk): Minimal collision risk due to large lateral distance.
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's relative lateral speed of 8.13 m/s means it is moving away from the ego vehicle, and the longitudinal alignment (0.0 m) indicates no immediate path to collision. Sufficient time to react exists with the absence of longitudinal velocity.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk): No significant collision risk as the obstacle is moving away.
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk): The overall situation remains manageable and does not pose an imminent threat.

- **Obstacle ID**: 30603.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is laterally 10.79 m away and moving toward the ego vehicle from the left. The longitudinal distance is still at 0.0 m.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk): Moderately concerning due to closer proximity and the motion towards the ego vehicle.
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative lateral velocity is -0.17 m/s, indicating that the obstacle is getting closer slowly. The latest assessment indicates that there may be a potential for collision in the upcoming seconds, but reaction time could still allow maneuvering.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk): Reaction strategies can be employed to avoid collision, albeit it requires timely action.
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk): The presence of the obstacle poses a moderate risk which is manageable with appropriate response.

- **Obstacle ID**: 30604.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is laterally -2.45 m away, indicating it is very close and has longitudinal velocity moving directly toward the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk): Close proximity and trajectory suggest a high collision risk.
  - **Time Risk reason**: With relative longitudinal velocity of 6.54 m/s and lateral velocity of 4.93 m/s, the obstacle is approaching quickly. The imminent approach warrants immediate attention to avoid a collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk): Quick responses are necessary due to the progressively reducing distance and high relative speed.
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk): High likelihood of collision requires urgent action from the ego vehicle.
