### Safety analysis for timestep 5.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30601.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The Longitudinal Distance (DTClong) is 0.0 m, indicating that the obstacle is exactly aligned with the ego vehicle. The Lateral Distance (DTClat) is 39.07 m, which is substantial. The obstacle is moving away laterally, indicating a safe trajectory away from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: **4** (Low Risk). The considerable lateral distance makes it manageable.

- **Time Risk reason**: The lateral relative velocity (Vrel_lat) is 8.13 m/s, suggesting the obstacle is moving away quickly, while the longitudinal relative velocity (Vrel_long) is only 0.15 m/s, indicating that the obstacle is not closing in. The TTC for lateral motion is not applicable since it is moving away. With a substantial distance and low chance of closing, the risk is minimal.
- **Time safety score**: **4** (Low Risk). The TTC is effectively safe due to the moving away behavior.

- **Overall Risk score**: **4** (Low Risk).

#### Obstacle ID: 30603.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The Longitudinal Distance (DTClong) is 0.0 m, meaning the obstacle is exactly aligned with the ego vehicle. The Lateral Distance (DTClat) is 10.79 m and decreasing since itâ€™s driving toward the ego vehicle from the left. This indicates that it is closing distance.
- **Distance safety score**: **3** (Medium Risk). The decreasing lateral distance brings moderate risk.

- **Time Risk reason**: The lateral relative velocity (Vrel_lat) is -0.17 m/s, indicating that the vehicle is moving closer, while the longitudinal relative velocity is 0.0 m/s. The TTC laterally can be calculated as follows:
  - \( TTC = \frac{distance}{relative\ velocity} = \frac{10.79 m}{0.17 m/s} \approx 63.47 \text{ seconds} \).
This high time to collision indicates that while the distance is decreasing, it is slowly doing so over a considerable amount of time.
- **Time safety score**: **4** (Low Risk). While there is a conflict in trajectories, the slow approach provides sufficient time for reaction.

- **Overall Risk score**: **3** (Medium Risk).

#### Obstacle ID: 30604.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The Longitudinal Distance (DTClong) is 0.0 m, meaning this obstacle is exactly aligned longitudinally with the ego vehicle. The Lateral Distance (DTClat) is -2.45 m (2.45 m to the right side of the ego vehicle) and is intruding into the ego vehicle's lane.
- **Distance safety score**: **2** (High Risk). The vehicle is not only in direct path but moving toward the ego vehicle laterally.

- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocities indicate the obstacle is approaching quickly: the longitudinal velocity (Vrel_long) is 6.54 m/s and lateral velocity (Vrel_lat) is 4.93 m/s. For lateral motion, the TTC is:
  - \( TTC = \frac{2.45 m}{4.93 m/s} \approx 0.50 \text{ seconds} \).
This indicates an immediate threat of collision.
- **Time safety score**: **1** (Extreme Risk). The very small time to collision means urgent action is required.

- **Overall Risk score**: **1** (Extreme Risk).
