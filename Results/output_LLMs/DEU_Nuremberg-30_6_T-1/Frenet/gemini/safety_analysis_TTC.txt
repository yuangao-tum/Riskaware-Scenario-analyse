### Safety analysis for timestep 5.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30601.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far away laterally (39.07m) and longitudinally aligned (0.0m) to the left of the ego vehicle, moving further away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Lateral velocity is high (8.13 m/s) moving away, longitudinal velocity is low (0.15 m/s). No TTC calculated as it's moving away.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30603.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Laterally close (10.79m) to the left of the ego vehicle, and longitudinally aligned (0.0m).  The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle laterally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Lateral velocity is low (-0.17 m/s) towards the ego vehicle.  TTClat = 10.79m / 0.17 m/s = 63.5s. Longitudinal velocity is negligible.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30604.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Very close laterally (2.45m) to the right of the ego vehicle, and longitudinally aligned (0.0m). The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle both laterally and longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Lateral velocity is relatively high (4.93 m/s) towards the ego vehicle. TTClat = 2.45m / 4.93 m/s = 0.5s.  Longitudinal velocity is high (6.54 m/s), but since the longitudinal distance is zero, it doesn't add to the risk in this specific timestep. If not exactly aligned in future steps it could become a factor.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1
