### Safety analysis for timestep 5.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 30601.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is located laterally at 39.07 m to the left with a minimal longitudinal distance (0.0 m). Since it is moving away with a lateral velocity of 8.13 m/s, the collision risk is reduced.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The time to collision laterally is increasing due to its high speed moving away, indicating no imminent collision threat.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30603.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is 10.79 m to the left laterally, with 0.0 m longitudinally. The obstacle is moving slightly towards the ego car with a lateral velocity of -0.17 m/s, indicating slow convergence.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Due to its low relative speed, the time to potential intersection laterally is considerable, thus the collision risk is manageably low.
  - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30604.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** At a lateral distance of -2.45 m and 0.0 m longitudinally, this obstacle is quite close. The obstacle has a lateral velocity of 4.93 m/s towards the ego car, shortening the lateral separation.
  - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** With its approaching velocity and small lateral gap, the expected time to collision is quite short demanding immediate reaction.
  - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```
In this scenario, no obstacles have an overall risk score of 0 or 1, as obstacles are either moving away or have manageable risk with prompt attention.
