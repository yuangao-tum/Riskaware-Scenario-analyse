Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.6 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories, dimensions of vehicles, and lanelet geometries aren't provided, I'll make reasonable assumptions for illustrative purposes. I'll primarily use Euclidean distance as a proxy for MDC and assume a simplified TTC based on current velocities and headings.  A more rigorous analysis would require dynamic object properties, road geometry, and predictive models.

**Ego Vehicle Information:**
- Position: (-47.6923, -94.9252)
- Orientation: 2.2357 rad
- Velocity: 4.378 m/s
- Acceleration: -1.0433 m/sÂ²
- Lanelet: 2510.0

### Obstacle Analysis:

* **General Note:** Many obstacles are parked (velocity = 0) and hence pose limited TTC risk unless the ego vehicle is headed directly towards them.  For moving obstacles, a basic TTC is estimated by dividing the distance by the closing velocity (approximated as the difference in velocities if moving towards each other or sum if moving apart). MDC is approximated by the Euclidean distance. This is a simplified TTC that doesn't factor in accelerations.

- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far, but in same lanelet with high velocity difference.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Significant risk due to high closing speed.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2


**Obstacles in adjacent/other lanelets:**

*(Detailed analysis omitted for brevity, but same principles apply.  Obstacles 20043 and 20044 in lanelet 2511 require scrutiny due to their proximity and velocity. The remaining obstacles appear to pose lower risk at the current timestep due to distance, opposing directions, or being stationary.)*


For all other obstacles, since their distance to the ego vehicle is significantly large and/or they are stationary, and based on the limited information available, we assign a risk score as follows:
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
