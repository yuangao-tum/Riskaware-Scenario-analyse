Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.6 seconds):
I'll analyze the safety metrics for the ego vehicle (ID: 20109.0) and nearby obstacles.

Key observations:
1. Ego vehicle is traveling in lanelet 2510.0
2. Several vehicles share the same lanelet or adjacent lanelets
3. The ego vehicle's speed is decreasing from ~10.5 m/s to ~4.4 m/s throughout the scenario

Detailed Safety Analysis:

1. Obstacle 20095.0 (Vehicle in same lanelet 2510.0):
- Distance Risk: High risk due to consistently close longitudinal distance (~20m)
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk: High risk due to decreasing speeds and closing distance
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

2. Obstacle 20101.0 (Vehicle in same lanelet 2510.0):
- Distance Risk: Moderate risk with longitudinal distance ~30m
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk: Moderate due to similar speed profiles
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

3. Obstacle 20107.0 (Vehicle in same lanelet 2510.0):
- Distance Risk: Low risk with sufficient longitudinal distance
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk: Low due to maintaining safe distance
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

4. Obstacle 20111.0 (Vehicle in same lanelet 2510.0):
- Distance Risk: Extreme risk due to very close longitudinal distance
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk: Extreme due to closing gap and higher speed
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

Summary JSON:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20111.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
```

Key findings:
1. Most critical risk is from Obstacle 20111.0 due to close proximity and speed differential
2. No immediate collisions detected but several high-risk situations
3. Ego vehicle's decreasing speed helps mitigate some risks
4. Most other vehicles maintain safe distances and speeds
