Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.6 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

The Ego vehicle is located at (-47.6923, -94.9252) with a velocity of 4.378 m/s and is decelerating at -1.0433 m/sÂ². The position of the obstacles and their velocities are analyzed to determine collision risks.

**1. Identify Obstacles in the Same Lanelet:**

The Ego vehicle is in lanelet 2510.0. The following obstacles are in lanelet 2510.0: 20090, 20092, 20095, 20101, 20105, 20107, 20111, 20112, 20114.

**2. Calculate the Metrics for Each Relevant Obstacle:**

The calculations for Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) will be provided based on the objects in the same lanelet.

**Obstacle Analysis:**

- **Obstacle ID: 20090**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is relatively stationary (-5.9035, -9.9621 with a velocity of 0).
  - Distance safety score: 1 (Potential imminent collision).
  - Time Risk reason: With no relative motion, TTC is effectively 0 which is dangerous.
  - Time safety score: 1.
  - Overall Risk score: 1.

- **Obstacle ID: 20092**
  - Distance Risk reason: Similar to 20090, stationary obstacle is very close to the Ego's trajectory.
  - Distance safety score: 1.
  - Time Risk reason: TTC is also effectively 0.
  - Time safety score: 1.
  - Overall Risk score: 1.

- **Obstacle ID: 20095**
  - Distance Risk reason: Moving towards negative Y direction but offers no significant movement towards Ego's path in the next few seconds.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Safe distance observed).
  - Time Risk reason: Moderate TTC due to relative speeds (TTC = 3 seconds considering Ego deceleration and Obstacle movement).
  - Time safety score: 3.
  - Overall Risk score: 3.

- **Obstacle ID: 20101**
  - Distance Risk reason: Fast moving obstacle in the same lanelet (11.498 m/s towards concrete vector directions).
  - Distance safety score: 1 (Very close considering path).
  - Time Risk reason: TTC and vector movement leads to an imminent collision.
  - Time safety score: 1.
  - Overall Risk score: 1.

- **Obstacle ID: 20105**
  - Distance Risk reason: Fast-establishing proximity and trajectory of risk.
  - Distance safety score: 1.
  - Time Risk reason: Rapidly colliding trajectory with Ego.
  - Time safety score: 1.
  - Overall Risk score: 1.

- **Obstacle ID: 20107**
  - Distance Risk reason: More distance relative to the current Ego trajectory.
  - Distance safety score: 3.
  - Time Risk reason: Managed time due to the relative speed (TTC = around 3 seconds).
  - Time safety score: 3.
  - Overall Risk score: 3.

- **Obstacle ID: 20111**
  - Distance Risk reason: Fast velocity and close proximity to Ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (Close proximity).
  - Time Risk reason: Immediate collision risk due to speed (TTC around 1 second).
  - Time safety score: 2.
  - Overall Risk score: 2.

- **Obstacle ID: 20112**
  - Distance Risk reason: Fast moving towards Ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 2.
  - Time Risk reason: Conflicted trajectory leading to high risk.
  - Time safety score: 2.
  - Overall Risk score: 2.

- **Obstacle ID: 20114**
  - Distance Risk reason: Stationary with a safe margin relatively.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (More space observed).
  - Time Risk reason: Safe relative time for avoidance.
  - Time safety score: 4.
  - Overall Risk score: 4.
