Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.6 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 20043**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is in the forward trajectory of the ego vehicle, but on a separate lanelet. The distance isn't directly threatening, but it's relatively close in lateral distance.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** The velocities and acceleration indicate a movement away from the ego vehicle's straight path, decreasing the immediate collision risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 4
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20044**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned further laterally making it less of a threat despite its forward position.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** The difference in velocity and trajectory indicates a negligible collision risk for the near future.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20057**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is located ahead but with significant lateral clearance.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Lesser TTC impact due to non-overlapping trajectory with the ego vehicle.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20059**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned outside the immediate trajectory of the ego vehicle and sufficient lateral clearance.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Lateral positioning and velocity suggest minimal interaction in close timeframes.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20061 to 20076 (Inclusive)**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** All placed laterally to the ego vehicle path with significant distance, are unlikely to interact.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Stationary and or significantly positioned laterally, offering near-zero risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20088 to 20100 (Inclusive)**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Far from the ego's pathway with velocity almost zero or non-threatening.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Positioned to not interfere with the current trajectory across both dimensions.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20101**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Close location in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle implies a higher collision potential.
  - **Distance safety score:** 2
  - **Time Risk reason:** With different velocities, a careful maneuver is needed to avoid collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 3
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3

- **Obstacle ID: 20102 to 20114 (Inclusive)**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned far with little or no velocity, these are not immediate threats.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Multiple stationary or negative trend impacting future collision course as low.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5
