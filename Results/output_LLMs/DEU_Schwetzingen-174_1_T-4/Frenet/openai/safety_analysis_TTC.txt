### Safety analysis for timestep <3.6 seconds>: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
#### - Obstacle ID: 20043.0
- Distance Risk reason: Lateral distance of -39.39 m combined with a longitudinal distance of 37.94 m shows a significant space between the ego car and the obstacle, with the obstacle moving toward the ego car, leading to a potential collision.
- Distance safety score: **2** (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Calculating TTC: 
  - Longitudinal TTC = \( \frac{-D_{TClong}}{V_{rel\_long}} = \frac{-37.94}{-4.86} \approx 7.79 \) seconds
  - Lateral TTC = \( \frac{-D_{TClat}}{V_{rel\_lat}} = \frac{-39.39}{4.22} \approx 9.33 \) seconds
This indicates sufficient time to react; hence, low likelihood of immediate collision.
- Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: **3** (Medium Risk)

#### - Obstacle ID: 20044.0
- Distance Risk reason: Lateral distance -78.5 m and longitudinal distance 39.78 m indicates a manageable distance; however, the obstacle is moving toward the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: **2** (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: 
  - Longitudinal TTC = \( \frac{-D_{TClong}}{V_{rel\_long}} = \frac{-39.78}{-4.55} \approx 8.73 \) seconds
  - Lateral TTC = \( \frac{-D_{TClat}}{V_{rel\_lat}} = \frac{-78.5}{5.78} \approx 13.58 \) seconds
Reasonable time to react to minimize risk.
- Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: **3** (Medium Risk)

#### - Obstacle ID: 20057.0
- Distance Risk reason: Significant lateral distance of -98.5 m with longitudinal distance of 39.52 m implies a high overall distance risk.
- Distance safety score: **3** (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: 
  - Longitudinal TTC = \( \frac{-39.52}{-2.66} \approx 14.85 \) seconds
  - Lateral TTC = \( \frac{-98.5}{4.31} \approx 22.85 \) seconds
Adequate time for avoiding collision.
- Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: **4** (Low Risk)

#### - Obstacle ID: 20059.0
- Distance Risk reason: Distance of 28.99 m longitudinally with -108.71 m laterally suggests the obstacle is quite far; however, it is still moving towards the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: **2** (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: 
  - Longitudinal TTC = \( \frac{-D_{TClong}}{V_{rel\_long}} = \frac{-28.99}{-1.18} \approx 24.57 \) seconds
  - Lateral TTC = \( \frac{-D_{TClat}}{V_{rel\_lat}} = \frac{-108.71}{2.2} \approx 49.41 \) seconds
Adequate reaction time to avert impact.
- Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: **4** (Low Risk)

#### - Obstacle ID: 20061.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is relatively close at longitudinal 18.57 m and lateral -115.56 m, indicates potential collision risk.
- Distance safety score: **2** (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: 
  - Longitudinal TTC = \( \frac{-18.57}{-2.01} \approx 9.23 \) seconds
  - Lateral TTC = \( \frac{-115.56}{1.34} \approx 86.19 \) seconds
Adequate time for reaction.
- Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: **3** (Medium Risk)

#### - Obstacle ID: 20071.0
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close distance at 1.05 m longitudinally with -123.83 m laterally, suggesting urgent collision risk.
- Distance safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason: 
  - Longitudinal TTC = \( \frac{-1.05}{-3.76} \approx 0.28 \) seconds, implies immediate collision risk.
  - Lateral TTC = \( \frac{-123.83}{0.19} \approx 651.68 \) seconds
Immediate urgent response required.
- Time safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: **1** (Extreme Risk)

#### - Obstacle ID: 20073.0
- Distance Risk reason: Exact longitudinal alignment indicates a high collision risk.
- Distance safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason: 
  - Longitudinal TTC = 0 seconds (exacting alignment),
  - Lateral TTC = \(\frac{-125.61}{0.02} \approx 6280.5 \) seconds
Immediate urgent response required.
- Time safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: **1** (Extreme Risk)

#### - Obstacle ID: 20088.0
- Distance Risk reason: 37.21 m longitudinally with -90.84 m laterally gives sufficient room but with potential threat as the obstacle is moving toward the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: **3** (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: 
  - Longitudinal TTC = \( \frac{-37.21}{-4.36} \approx 8.54 \) seconds
  - Lateral TTC = \( \frac{-90.84}{-0.11} \approx 820.36 \) seconds
Good time available to prevent collision.
- Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: **4** (Low Risk)
