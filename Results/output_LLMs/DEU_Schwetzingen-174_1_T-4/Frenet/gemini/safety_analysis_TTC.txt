### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 20043.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively far away (37.94m longitudinal, 39.39m lateral).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  TTC not precisely calculable, but ample time due to distance and moderate closing speed.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 20044.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Farther away than 20043.0.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  TTC not precisely calculable, but ample time due to distance and moderate closing speed.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 20057.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Even farther; no immediate concern.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No immediate concern.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 20059.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Starting to get closer laterally, but still safe longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Moderate closing speed.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 20061.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Longitudinal distance decreasing (18.57m). Lateral distance substantial.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  TTC warrants monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 20063.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Longitudinal distance now quite close (9.28m). Lateral distance still substantial but decreasing.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Requires attention.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 20071.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Extremely close longitudinally (1.05m). Lateral offset provides some margin, but a high risk situation.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Very short TTC.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 20073.0**
- Distance Risk reason: At the same longitudinal position as the ego vehicle. Lateral offset provides some margin, but the relative longitudinal velocity and near-zero longitudinal distance represent imminent collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Collision likely without immediate evasive action.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1


**- Obstacle ID: 20074.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Slightly behind the ego vehicle longitudinally; lateral offset large. Moving away longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


**- Obstacle ID: 20076.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Farther behind the ego vehicle than 20074.0 and moving away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  No risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 20088.0** through **- Obstacle ID: 20110.0**
- Distance Risk reason: All these obstacles are at relatively safe distances both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5 or 4 (depending on specific distances)
- Time Risk reason: No immediate risk due to the distances involved.
- Time safety score: 4 or 5 (depending on specific distances and velocities)
- Overall Risk score: 4 or 5

**- Obstacle ID: 20111.0**
- Distance Risk reason: At the same position as the ego vehicle (0m longitudinal and lateral distance). This indicates a collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: TTC is zero as there is already a collision.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 20112.0** through **- Obstacle ID: 20114.0**
- Distance Risk reason: These obstacles are behind the ego vehicle but approaching.  Lateral distances are relatively small and decreasing.
- Distance safety score: 4 or 3 (depending on specific distances)
- Time Risk reason:  These require monitoring but not immediate concern.
- Time safety score: 3 or 4 (depending on specific distances and velocities)
- Overall Risk score: 3 or 4
