### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID:** 20043.0
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance is 37.94 m and lateral distance is -39.39 m. The negative lateral distance indicates the obstacle is in the front-right but far enough that there isn’t an immediate collision path.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal relative velocity is -4.86 m/s, leading to a TTC of 7.8 seconds (TTC_long = 37.94/4.86). Lateral motion indicates good initial distance. Thus, the TTC demonstrates sufficient time to react.
   - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID:** 20044.0
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Similar to obstacle 20043.0, the longitudinally relative motion still allows for sufficient distance and time to react.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** TTC_long = 39.78/4.55 = 8.7 seconds. This is a comfortable amount of time to react to the obstacle's movement.
   - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID:** 20057.0
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is 39.52 m and lateral distance at -98.5 m gives a clear buffer zone.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** TTC_long = 39.52/2.66 = 14.85 seconds showing a very low probability of collision in this timestep.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID:** 20059.0
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The ego vehicle is still well-separated from the obstacle, maintaining safety with 28.99 m longitudinally.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** TTC_long = 28.99/1.18 = 24.6 seconds which provides significant leeway for adjustments.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID:** 20061.0
   - **Distance Risk reason:** 18.57 m longitudinally; while tighter, it is still within manageable distance.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** TTC_long = 18.57/2.01 = 9.23 seconds, showing manageable risks.
   - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID:** 20063.0
   - **Distance Risk reason:** 9.28 m longitudinally is tight; danger could be imminent without prompt reaction.
   - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** TTC_long = 9.28/2.96 = 3.13 seconds showing a risk that requires immediate attention.
   - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

7. **Obstacle ID:** 20071.0
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Very close – 1.05 m longitudinally which poses a severe risk.
   - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** TTC_long does not need calculation as the distance indicates collision. Immediate action required.
   - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

8. **Obstacle ID:** 20073.0
   - **Distance Risk reason:** 0.0 m longitudinally indicates an exact or extreme risk level for collision.
   - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Again, the distance indicates a certain collision.
   - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

9. **Obstacle ID:** 20111.0
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Exact collision point (0.0 m) creates an immediate collision risk.
   - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Collision is imminent; thus, time risk is severe.
   - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20111.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20071.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
```
### Conclusion:
The assessment shows multiple obstacles with varying levels of risk. Immediate action is recommended for obstacles with scores of 1 (extreme collision risk). Most other obstacles are categorized with lower risk scores, indicating manageable scenarios.
