Safety analysis for the last timestep (11.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 11.7 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30573.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:**
    - The obstacle is stationary in lanelet 2084.0, not directly in the path of the ego vehicle located at lanelet 811.0.
    - The minimum distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle is relatively large.
  - **Distance safety score: 5**
  - **Time Risk reason:**
    - Since both TTC longitudinal and lateral indicate no interception due to lanelet sufficiency, the time to collision is not applicable.
  - **Time safety score: 5**
  - **Overall Risk score: 5**

- **Obstacle ID: 30574.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:**
    - The distance is significant, and the obstacle is located in a different lanelet (2102.0), moving away.
  - **Distance safety score: 5**
  - **Time Risk reason:**
    - TTC values indicate no potential collision trajectory with the current path and velocities.
  - **Time safety score: 5**
  - **Overall Risk score: 5**

- **Obstacle ID: 30575.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:**
    - Positioned in lanelet 2339.0, moving rapidly away with a significant distance.
  - **Distance safety score: 5**
  - **Time Risk reason:**
    - No intersection prediction with current trajectories and speed vectors.
  - **Time safety score: 5**
  - **Overall Risk score: 5**

- **Obstacle ID: 30576.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:**
    - The obstacle in lanelet 2101.0 is moving tangentially away from ego path with significant lateral clearance.
  - **Distance safety score: 5**
  - **Time Risk reason:**
    - With current lateral offset and velocities, no imminent collision predicted.
  - **Time safety score: 5**
  - **Overall Risk score: 5**

- **Obstacle ID: 30578.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:**
    - Located in lanelet 2088.0 with no direct conflict with the ego's lanelet path; moving away.
  - **Distance safety score: 5**
  - **Time Risk reason:**
    - No collision expected given TTClong and TTClat calculations.
  - **Time safety score: 5**
  - **Overall Risk score: 5**

- **Obstacle ID: 30579.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:**
    - Although positioned in the same lanelet (811.0), it is stationary and slightly offset in terms of lateral direction such that it is not blocking the ego's course directly.
  - **Distance safety score: 4**
  - **Time Risk reason:**
    - With low ego velocity and stationary state of the obstacle, the TTC is not critical, but caution is advised.
  - **Time safety score: 4**
  - **Overall Risk score: 4**

- **Obstacle ID: 30581.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:**
    - Lanelet 2085.0 indicates movement away in a lateral direction, maintaining sufficient separation.
  - **Distance safety score: 5**
  - **Time Risk reason:**
    - TTC does not indicate a collision path with the ego's trajectory.
  - **Time safety score: 5**
  - **Overall Risk score: 5**

- **Obstacle ID: 30582.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:**
    - Located in lanelet 829.0, moving away; significant lateral distance ensures no intersecting paths.
  - **Distance safety score: 5**
  - **Time Risk reason:**
    - TTClong and TTClat indicate no potential for collision under current movement patterns.
  - **Time safety score: 5**
  - **Overall Risk score: 5**

### Summary in JSON Format: 
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```
The analysis indicates that there are no collision risks or extreme risk situations in the current scenario. The movements and positions relative to the ego vehicle provide no significant risks as calculated through TTC and MDC metrics.
