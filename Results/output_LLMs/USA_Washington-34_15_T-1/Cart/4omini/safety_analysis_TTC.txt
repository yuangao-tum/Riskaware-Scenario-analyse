Safety analysis for the last timestep (11.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 11.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID**: 30573.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance between Ego and this stationary obstacle is significant (> 10 meters), hence minimal immediate collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Since the obstacle is stationary (velocity: 0.0), TTC is theoretically infinite. However, Ego's orientation appears to be slightly away, further decreasing collision risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID**: 30574.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The position of this moving obstacle (velocity: 8.8314) is reasonably close but will likely move away from Ego’s path due to their respective angles.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Even with its significant speed, the angle may prevent an immediate collision as it’s moving relatively away from the trajectory of Ego.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID**: 30575.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is located at a moderate distance vertically but is moving at a high speed towards the direction of Ego.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC might be around 3 seconds at current velocity calculations, prompting a careful maneuvering to avoid collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID**: 30576.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Close distance and moving towards Ego make this situation slightly risky.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: With the speed and proximity, the TTC might range around 2-3 seconds.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID**: 30578.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is relatively further back but is also moving towards Ego, creating some risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Given its speed and position, there is a moderate TTC implying action is required.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID**: 30579.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary, resulting in a clear lane for Ego, hence presenting minimal distance risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC is infinite for this obstacle since it is not moving.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID**: 30581.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This moving obstacle is not too close but is traveling quickly across Ego's path.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: The calculated TTC is moderate considering their velocities, suggesting that Ego may need to react but is manageable.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID**: 30582.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Moderate proximity and relative positioning make this obstacle's risk manageable but notable.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Estimated TTC indicates some seconds available to react.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
``` 

### Conclusion:
The analysis reveals no immediate collision hazards (Overall Risk Score: 0) or extreme risks (Overall Risk Score: 1). Obstacles pose varying risks (2 to 4), indicating a generally manageable potential for collision with attention required towards several moving obstacles.
