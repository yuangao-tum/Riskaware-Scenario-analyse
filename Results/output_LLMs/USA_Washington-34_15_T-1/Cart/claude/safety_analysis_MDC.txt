Safety analysis for the last timestep (11.7 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario for collision risks, focusing on obstacles in proximity to the ego vehicle's path.

Key observations from the trajectory data:
1. The ego vehicle is traveling in lanelets 59 -> 1405 -> 819 -> 811
2. Most relevant obstacles sharing or intersecting the ego's path:
   - Obstacle 30579: Moving in lanelet 1405
   - Obstacle 30572: Moving in lanelet 808
   - Obstacle 30581: Moving in lanelet 830/837

Detailed Safety Analysis:

For Obstacle 30579 (Most critical):
- Distance Risk reason: Initially starts at ~30m ahead in the same lanelet (59), maintaining relatively close longitudinal distance
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low risk due to maintaining safe following distance)
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity indicates stable following distance, no immediate collision risk
- Time safety score: 4 (Low risk with sufficient reaction time)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low risk situation)

For Obstacle 30572:
- Distance Risk reason: Located in adjacent lanelet 808, maintaining lateral separation
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible risk due to lateral separation)
- Time Risk reason: No direct path intersection
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible risk)

For Obstacle 30581:
- Distance Risk reason: Operating in parallel lanelet 830/837
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low risk due to consistent lateral separation)
- Time Risk reason: No direct path conflict
- Time safety score: 4 (Low risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low risk)

Overall Assessment:
The scenario shows generally safe conditions with:
1. No immediate collision risks (no score of 0)
2. No extreme risks (no score of 1)
3. All observed obstacles maintain safe distances and trajectories
4. The ego vehicle's deceleration from ~28 km/h to lower speeds increases safety margins
5. Lateral separations between vehicles remain stable throughout the scenario

The key safety factors are:
- Consistent lateral separation between vehicles
- Controlled longitudinal distances
- No sudden trajectory changes
- Gradual speed adjustments
- Clear lane discipline
