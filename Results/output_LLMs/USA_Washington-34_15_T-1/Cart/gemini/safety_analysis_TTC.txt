Safety analysis for the last timestep (11.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 11.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories, dimensions of vehicles, and precise definitions of "collision" (e.g., overlap of bounding boxes) are not provided, I will make reasonable assumptions for illustrative purposes.  I will focus on relative positions, velocities, and headings to estimate risk. A more rigorous analysis would require the missing information.  I will also assume a collision occurs if the MDC is effectively 0.

**Calculations (Illustrative):**

Due to the lack of precise data, I'll make illustrative estimates for TTC and MDC.  Let's assume a safety buffer of 2 meters for MDC.

* **TTC Estimation**:  Simplified TTC based on closing velocities.  If velocities are not directly towards/away from each other, a more sophisticated calculation would be needed.
* **MDC Estimation**: Based on Euclidean distance minus the safety buffer.
