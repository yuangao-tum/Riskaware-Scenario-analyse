### Safety analysis for timestep 11.7 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30573.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance (19.79 m) and lateral distance (4.47 m) indicate that the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle. Although relatively far, the longitudinal approach creates a risk.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocity longitudinal (-0.56 m/s) indicates that the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle, but at a safe distance. The TTC is approximately 35.3 seconds (19.79 m / 0.56 m/s), indicating a manageable time to collision.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30574.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is 32.03 m away longitudinally, which is safe. The lateral distance (-0.04 m) indicates it is almost aligned but moving away.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is moving away longitudinally (velocity 8.26 m/s). This indicates no risk of collision; in fact, it is moving away.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30575.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance (18.87 m) is safe, while the lateral distance (-14.74 m) indicates a gap to the right of the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is moving away longitudinally, reducing collision risk considerably (TTC = 5.77 seconds; manageable).
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 30576.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance (13.5 m) is manageable, with some lateral distance to the right (-0.64 m).
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is also moving away, suggesting a safe scenario (TTC = 7.25 seconds; safe).
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 30578.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance is a concerning 9.01 m, with a substantial lateral presence (8.21 m), suggesting potential risk.
   - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocity indicates the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle laterally. The TTC cannot be calculated accurately here due to the mixed direction but suggests some urgency (potential risk).
   - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID: 30579.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The vehicle is only 0.24 m away (extremely close) in the longitudinal direction, indicating an immediate risk.
   - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** It is approaching with a relative velocity of -0.56 m/s. The TTC is around 0.43 seconds, indicating an imminent collision.
   - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

7. **Obstacle ID: 30581.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance (19.23 m) and near alignment laterally show a safe situation.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is moving away longitudinally with an effective clearance.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

8. **Obstacle ID: 30582.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance of 4.27 m poses some risk but laterally indicates further distance (18.85 m).
   - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** With no critical velocity or acceleration risk noted, the situation can be managed.
   - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
