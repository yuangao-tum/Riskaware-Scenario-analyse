### Safety analysis for timestep 11.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30573.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Moderately close longitudinally (19.79m) and laterally (4.47m) in the front-left.  
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (-0.56 m/s), no lateral relative motion. The positive longitudinal acceleration (0.29 m/s²) suggests the ego vehicle might be braking or the obstacle accelerating, decreasing risk but still cause for attention.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30574.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Safe distance longitudinally (32.03m) and laterally (-0.04m) in front-right. Moving away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally (8.26 m/s) and laterally (-0.43 m/s).
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30575.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Safe distance longitudinally (18.87m) and laterally (-14.74m) in front-right. Moving away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally (3.27 m/s) and laterally (-8.79 m/s).
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30576.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively close longitudinally (13.5m) but moving away laterally (-0.64m) in front-right.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally (1.86 m/s) and laterally (-7.35 m/s).
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30578.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Close longitudinally (9.01m) and moderately close laterally (8.21m) in front-left.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally (1.28 m/s) but approaching laterally (-4.13 m/s). Lateral acceleration towards ego (5.06 m/s²) increases risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30579.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close longitudinally (0.24m) and exact lateral alignment (0.0m) in front.  This indicates imminent collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (-0.56 m/s), no lateral relative motion.  
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 30581.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Safe distance longitudinally (19.23m) and laterally (0.43m) in front-left. Moving away longitudinally but slightly towards laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally (5.56 m/s) but approaching laterally (-4.32 m/s). However, the lateral acceleration is away from the ego (-1.29 m/s²), reducing risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30582.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Close longitudinally (4.27m) and far laterally (18.85m) in front-left.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally (1.23 m/s) but approaching laterally (-4.02 m/s) with increasing lateral acceleration towards ego (1.67 m/s²). Requires attention.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2
