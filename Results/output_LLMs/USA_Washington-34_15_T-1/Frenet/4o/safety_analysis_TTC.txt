### Safety analysis for timestep 11.7 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**1. Obstacle ID: 30573.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is relatively close with a longitudinal distance of 19.79 meters and a lateral distance of 4.47 meters, predominantly in the front-left direction.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Moderate distance with some risks due to proximity and position)
- **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal velocity indicates the obstacle is slowly approaching the ego car, suggesting moderate time risk to collision.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Moderate time to collision, but manageable)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

**2. Obstacle ID: 30574.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is quite far at 32.03 meters (longitudinal) and almost centered laterally.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low risk due to large distance)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away, reducing collision potential over time.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Minimal collision risk as itâ€™s moving away)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

**3. Obstacle ID: 30575.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at a moderate distance (18.87 meters longitudinal) and lateral separation further reduces collision potential.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low risk due to lateral separation)
- **Time Risk reason**: Given its motion away longitudinally and laterally, time risk is minimized.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Minimal time risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

**4. Obstacle ID: 30576.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: At 13.5 meters longitudinally, closer proximity but lateral deviation provides some safety margin.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Moderate risk given moderate proximity)
- **Time Risk reason**: Despite reasonable distance, lateral movement largely reduces immediate collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium risk with moderate time pressure)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

**5. Obstacle ID: 30578.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: Fairly close at 9.01 meters longitudinally and in motion toward ego laterally.
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High risk due to close proximity and converging lateral motion)
- **Time Risk reason**: Moderate linear and lateral velocity increases potential conflict if current trajectory is maintained.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Moderate time to collision, manageable with quick action)
- **Overall Risk score**: 2

**6. Obstacle ID: 30579.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: Extremely close at 0.24 meters, directly in front of the ego car.
- **Distance safety score**: 0 (Policy breach, too close)
- **Time Risk reason**: High likelihood of collision almost immediately as it is moving toward ego.
- **Time safety score**: 0 (Immediate collision risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 0

**7. Obstacle ID: 30581.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: Moderate proximity at 19.23 meters with relative lateral deviation, reducing uncertainty over approach path.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Manageable with moderate risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Lateral movement toward ego can pose risk if not promptly corrected.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

**8. Obstacle ID: 30582.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: Closer distance longitudinally at 4.27 meters but large lateral offset.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Moderate risk due to close longitudinal position)
- **Time Risk reason**: Movement pattern away longitudinally with a large initial lateral distance moderates immediate collision threat.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Minimized time collision risk, manageable)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3
