### Safety analysis for timestep 11.7 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30573.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** DTClong = 19.79 m (safe distance), DTClat = 4.47 m (potential collision risk due to driving towards the ego vehicle). However, given the longitudinal distance, the obstacle is not immediately threatening.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Vrel_long = -0.56 m/s suggests the obstacle is getting closer, but distance is manageable. The TTC = D / V = 19.79 m / 0.56 m/s = 35.34 seconds (safe time to react).
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30574.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** DTClong = 32.03 m and lateral position is -0.04 m instead of directly colliding. The obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Vrel_long = 8.26 m/s and moving away means a TTC of D / V = 32.03 m / 8.26 m/s = 3.87 seconds (still safe the distance increases).
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30575.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** DTClong = 18.87 m and DTClat = -14.74 m; the obstacle is moving away with a significant lateral distance.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Vrel_long = 3.27 m/s means TTC = 18.87 m / 3.27 m/s = 5.77 seconds (safe time to react).
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30576.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** DTClong = 13.5 m and DTClat = -0.64 m. Reasonable distance, but the obstacle is moving laterally towards the ego car.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Vrel_long = 1.86 m/s gives TTC = 13.5 m / 1.86 m/s = 7.24 seconds, distance allows for reaction.
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30578.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** DTClong = 9.01 m and DTClat = 8.21 m; while the lateral aspect is safe, the longitudinal distance may be worrying.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Vrel_long = 1.28 m/s means TTC = 9.01 m / 1.28 m/s = 7.03 seconds (enough time to react given the direction).
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30579.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** DTClong = 0.24 m (very close), and since the obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle, this is a critical situation.
  - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Vrel_long = -0.56 m/s means it's about to collide imminently. The TTC would be virtually zero.
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30581.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** DTClong = 19.23 m and DTClat = 0.43 m; this is a safe distance as the obstacle is moving away generally.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Vrel_long = 5.56 m/s indicates the obstacle is moving away safely. TTC = 19.23 m / 5.56 m/s = 3.46 seconds.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30582.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** DTClong = 4.27 m and DTClat = 18.85 m mean that the ego vehicle is relatively safe but the distance is small.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Vrel_long = 1.23 m/s gives a TTC of 4.27 m / 1.23 m/s = 3.47 seconds, sufficient time to react.
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

### Summary in JSON Format: 
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30579.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30579.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

In summary, the most critical obstacle presents an immediate risk of collision and requires urgent action, while the other obstacles pose varying levels of risk but none are a direct collision risk at this timestamp apart from Obstacle 30579.0.
