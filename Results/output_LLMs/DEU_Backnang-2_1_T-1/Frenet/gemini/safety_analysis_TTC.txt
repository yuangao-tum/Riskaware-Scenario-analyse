### Safety analysis for timestep 2.0s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 33.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in direct collision with the ego vehicle (DTClong = 0.0m, DTClat = 0.0m).
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason:  Already colliding, TTC is effectively zero.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 345.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Behind the ego vehicle, but relatively close (DTClong = -14.67m).  Approaching from behind (Vrel_long = 2.59 m/s).
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Potentially short TTC if ego vehicle brakes suddenly.  Needs further calculation but likely a risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 350.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Far away (DTClong = 48.23m, DTClat = -21.05m).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching slowly (Vrel_long = -0.82 m/s), no immediate concern.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 358.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Far away (DTClong = 49.19m, DTClat = -13.7m).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Approaching slowly (Vrel_long = -0.83 m/s), no immediate concern.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 367.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Far away (DTClong = 50.29m, DTClat = -6.28m).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Approaching slowly (Vrel_long = -0.83 m/s), no immediate concern.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 369.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively far (DTClong = -36.12m, DTClat = 28.08m). Moving away longitudinally, but approaching laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  No immediate time risk longitudinally.  Lateral motion needs further analysis but doesn't appear immediately dangerous.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 374.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Far away (DTClong = 51.42m, DTClat = 0.0m).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching slowly (Vrel_long = -0.83 m/s), no immediate concern.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 378.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively close (DTClong = 8.3m, DTClat = -1.07m).  Moving away longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: No immediate time risk as it is moving away.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 380.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close (DTClong = 13.51m, DTClat = -7.9m). Moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (Vrel_long = -1.74 m/s), needs attention.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 383.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close (DTClong = 16.94m, DTClat = 12.08m). Moving closer both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (Vrel_long = -1.28 m/s), needs attention. Lateral motion also concerning.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2
