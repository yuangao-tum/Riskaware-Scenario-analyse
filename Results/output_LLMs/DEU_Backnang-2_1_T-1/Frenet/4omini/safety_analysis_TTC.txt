### Safety analysis for timestep 2.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 33.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: DTClong = 0.0 m, DTClat = 0.0 m suggests the ego vehicle and the obstacle are in direct contact.
  - **Distance safety score**: **0** (Extremely high risk as collision is ongoing)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC cannot be calculated as the vehicles are already colliding.
  - **Time safety score**: **0** (Collision is immediate)
  - **Overall Risk score**: **0**

- **Obstacle ID: 345.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: DTClong = -14.67 m shows the obstacle is behind the ego car, but the distance is significant enough not to cause direct collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: **4** (Low risk; the obstacle is moving towards but not in immediate danger)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC can be calculated as follows: TTC = Distance / Relative velocity = |-14.67| / 2.59 ≈ 5.67s (enough time to react).
  - **Time safety score**: **4**
  - **Overall Risk score**: **4**

- **Obstacle ID: 350.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: DTClong = 48.23 m, DTClat = -21.05 m indicates significant distance with relative motion towards.
  - **Distance safety score**: **4** (Low risk; far enough not to cause collision)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC = 48.23 / 0.82 ≈ 58.8s, yielding ample time to react.
  - **Time safety score**: **5**
  - **Overall Risk score**: **4**

- **Obstacle ID: 358.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: DTClong = 49.19 m, DTClat = -13.7 m shows significant distance and moving away laterally.
  - **Distance safety score**: **4** (Low risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC = 49.19 / 0.83 ≈ 59.2s, resulting in ample time for response.
  - **Time safety score**: **5**
  - **Overall Risk score**: **4**

- **Obstacle ID: 367.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: DTClong = 50.29 m, DTClat = -6.28 m indicates a safe distance from a longitudinal perspective.
  - **Distance safety score**: **4** (Low risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC = 50.29 / 0.83 ≈ 60.5s, suggesting ample time.
  - **Time safety score**: **5**
  - **Overall Risk score**: **4**

- **Obstacle ID: 369.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: DTClong = -36.12 m, DTClat = 28.08 m indicates the obstacle is behind and laterally moving away.
  - **Distance safety score**: **4** (Low risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC can be calculated: TTC = |-36.12| / |-0.83| ≈ 43.5s (sufficient time).
  - **Time safety score**: **4**
  - **Overall Risk score**: **4**

- **Obstacle ID: 374.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: DTClong = 51.42 m indicates a safe distance from the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: **4** (Low risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC = 51.42 / 0.83 ≈ 62.0s, indicating significant time to react.
  - **Time safety score**: **5**
  - **Overall Risk score**: **4**

- **Obstacle ID: 378.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: DTClong = 8.3 m and lateral distance -1.07 m shows a safe proximity but requires attention.
  - **Distance safety score**: **4** (Low risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC = 8.3 / 1.41 ≈ 5.88s (requires timely reaction).
  - **Time safety score**: **3**
  - **Overall Risk score**: **3**

- **Obstacle ID: 380.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: DTClong = 13.51 m, lateral distance -7.9 m suggests a considerable gap.
  - **Distance safety score**: **4** (Low risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC = 13.51 / 1.74 ≈ 7.76s (sufficient for timely reaction).
  - **Time safety score**: **4**
  - **Overall Risk score**: **4**

- **Obstacle ID: 383.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: DTClong = 16.94 m, DTClat = 12.08 m indicates a reasonably safe distance from vehicles.
  - **Distance safety score**: **4** (Low risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC = 16.94 / 1.28 ≈ 13.23s (ample time to react).
  - **Time safety score**: **4**
  - **Overall Risk score**: **4**
