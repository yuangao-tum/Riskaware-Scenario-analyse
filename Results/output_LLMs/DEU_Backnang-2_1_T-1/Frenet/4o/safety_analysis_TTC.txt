### Safety analysis for timestep 2.0 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 33.0

- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is at the exact position of the ego vehicle with DTClong = 0.0 m and DTClat = 0.0 m. This implies a collision has already occurred.
- **Distance safety score**: 0
- **Time Risk reason**: As all distances are zero, the TTC becomes irrelevant because a collision is already present.
- **Time safety score**: 0
- **Overall Risk score**: 0

#### Obstacle ID: 345.0

- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle by 14.67 m longitudinally, indicating no immediate collision path.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: The TTC is relatively long given the relative velocity (2.59 m/s), suggesting an increasing distance or a stable relative state.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 350.0

- **Distance Risk reason**: 48.23 m longitudinal and -21.05 m lateral distance suggests it's far enough in front-right.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The negative relative velocity indicates an increase in distance between vehicles, implying longer TTC.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 358.0

- **Distance Risk reason**: With distances greater than 48 m, this obstacle poses no immediate risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away longitudinally; thus, TTC is expanding.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 367.0

- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned 50.29 m longitudinal and -6.28 m lateral indicating adequate separation.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is indicating motion away from the ego vehicle longitudinally.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 369.0

- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is at 36.12 m longitudinal and 28.08 m lateral distance and moving away longitudinally.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The negative longitudinal relative velocity confirms increasing distance, thus expanding TTC.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 374.0

- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at a 51.42 m longitudinal span in front, the obstacle is distanced away.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: With relative motion drawing away longitudinally, TTC is enhanced.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 378.0

- **Distance Risk reason**: Given the 8.3 m longitudinal and -1.07 m lateral distance with it moving away, small chance of collision.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is marginally moving away, keeping moderate TTC.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 380.0

- **Distance Risk reason**: Lateral and longitudinal positions show distancing, and the lateral movement is increasing.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Motion trends away laterally indicating a lesser TTC risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 383.0

- **Distance Risk reason**: 16.94 m longitudinal with lateral presence front-left, indicating manageable distance.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Negative relative lateral velocity is concerning but adjusted timewise.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4
