### Safety analysis for timestep 2.0 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 33.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The real distance is longitudinal 0.0 m (indicating it's directly in front) and lateral 0.0 m. This places it at an immediate risk of collision. 
  - **Distance safety score**: 1
  - **Time Risk reason**: With a relative velocity of 5.37 m/s (directly towards), TTC = 0.0 s is computed, indicating an immediate collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 1
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1

- **Obstacle ID**: 345.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance is longitudinal -14.67 m (behind the ego car). It’s not in immediate danger of collision but is approaching.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity of 2.59 m/s suggests it’s getting closer gradually. Thus, it does not pose an immediate threat.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID**: 350.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance is longitudinal 48.23 m and lateral -21.05 m; it is far away and poses minimal risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: With a longitudinal relative velocity of -0.82 m/s, it is moving away longitudinally. Therefore, TTC indicates no risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID**: 358.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: It is at 49.19 m longitudinally and -13.70 m laterally, placing it at a safe distance.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: The object is moving away laterally and longitudinally, meaning no immediate collision risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4
  
- **Obstacle ID**: 367.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at 50.29 m longitudinally and -6.28 m laterally; it is also at a safe distance.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Similar to other distant obstacles, it poses no immediate risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID**: 369.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Distance is -36.12 m longitudinally (behind) and laterally 28.08 m. It’s not a collision concern.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: As it's moving away longitudinally, this obstacle is not a threat.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID**: 374.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at 51.42 m longitudinally, safe distance.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: It is moving toward the ego car but poses no immediate risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID**: 378.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Distance is 8.3 m longitudinally and -1.07 m laterally, relatively close but still manageable.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Although it shows a relative velocity, it distinctly suggests distancing rather than approaching a collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID**: 380.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: 13.51 m longitudinally and -7.90 m laterally, again remains a safe distance.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: It is driving towards the ego car but shows distancing, indicating control.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID**: 383.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at 16.94 m longitudinally and 12.08 m laterally; this indicates a manageable distance from potential impact.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: While moving towards the ego car, it isn’t a concern due to the larger distance and velocity.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4
