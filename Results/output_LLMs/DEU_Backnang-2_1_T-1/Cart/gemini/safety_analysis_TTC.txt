Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.0 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories and dimensions of the vehicles aren't provided,  I'm making some simplified assumptions for this analysis.  I'll primarily use Euclidean distance as a proxy for both MDC and infer TTC based on closing velocities.  A more accurate analysis would require detailed trajectory predictions, vehicle shapes, and inter-vehicle orientation.

**Calculations and Reasoning:**

We will analyze each obstacle relative to the ego vehicle, considering their positions, velocities, and headings (orientations). 

**Lanelet Considerations:** Obstacles in different lanelets will be considered lower risk unless their trajectories indicate a potential intersection point with the ego vehicle's path.

**TTC Approximations:** TTC will be approximated based on current closing velocity and distance.  This is a simplification, as accelerations are present but not fully accounted for in this estimation due to lack of trajectory information.

**Obstacle Analysis:**

- **Obstacle ID: 33**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 33 is in the same lanelet and very close to the ego vehicle.
    - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: Given the proximity and relative velocities (Ego slower, Obstacle faster), a collision is imminent if the ego vehicle doesn't accelerate or the obstacle doesn't brake.
    - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 345**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 345 is in the same lanelet but further behind than 33.
    - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: Though further away, it's still closing in on the ego vehicle, and the relative velocities suggest a potential collision risk if speeds aren't adjusted.
    - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 350**
    - Distance Risk reason: Different lanelet, relatively far.
    - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
    - Time Risk reason:  Stationary and in a different lanelet.  
    - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 358**
    - Distance Risk reason: Different lanelet, relatively far.
    - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: Essentially stationary and in a different lanelet.
    - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 367**
    - Distance Risk reason: Different lanelet, relatively far.
    - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
    - Time Risk reason:  Very slow-moving and in a different lanelet.
    - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 369**
    - Distance Risk reason: Different lanelet, moderate distance.
    - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: Slow-moving and in a different lanelet, unclear trajectory intersection.
    - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 374**
    - Distance Risk reason: Different lanelet, relatively far.
    - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: Slow-moving and in a different lanelet.
    - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 378**
    - Distance Risk reason: Different lanelet, moderate distance, but approaching from a potentially intersecting trajectory.
    - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: Moderate speed and approaching from the side; trajectory prediction would be needed for a precise TTC.
    - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 380**
    - Distance Risk reason: Different lanelet, moderate distance, but potentially intersecting trajectory.
    - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: Relatively high speed and approaching; trajectory needs to be assessed.
    - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 383**
    - Distance Risk reason: Different lanelet, moderate distance, unclear trajectory.
    - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: Moderate speed, further assessment needed.
    - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)
