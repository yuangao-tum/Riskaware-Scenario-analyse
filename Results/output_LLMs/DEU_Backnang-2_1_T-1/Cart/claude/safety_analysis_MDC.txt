Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.0 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario for potential collisions:

1. First, identifying vehicles in the same lanelet (40728.0) as the ego vehicle:
- Obstacle 33.0 is in the same lanelet
- Other vehicles are in different lanelets

2. Distance and Time Analysis:

For Obstacle 33.0:
- Initial position: (513.12024, 915.71585)
- Final position: (516.16313, 922.86952)
- Moving in same direction as ego vehicle
- Relative velocity: Higher than ego (â‰ˆ6.19 m/s vs 0.825 m/s)
- MDC: Approximately 4-5 meters
- TTC: No immediate collision risk due to higher forward velocity

For other obstacles:
- Obstacle 378.0: In lanelet 41647, crosses nearby but maintains safe distance
- Obstacle 380.0: In lanelet 41309/41287, moving away from ego vehicle
- Remaining obstacles are in different lanelets with safe distances

Safety Analysis for critical period (0-2s):

For Obstacle 33.0:
- Distance Risk reason: Maintains safe longitudinal distance, no lateral conflict
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: No immediate collision risk due to higher forward velocity
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

For Obstacle 378.0:
- Distance Risk reason: Crosses nearby but maintains safe separation
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Trajectories don't intersect at critical points
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

There are no obstacles with collision risk (score 0) or extreme risk (score 1) in this scenario. The closest interaction is with Obstacle 33.0, but it maintains safe distance and higher velocity than the ego vehicle, resulting in low collision risk. Other vehicles are either in different lanelets or maintaining safe distances from the ego vehicle's path.
