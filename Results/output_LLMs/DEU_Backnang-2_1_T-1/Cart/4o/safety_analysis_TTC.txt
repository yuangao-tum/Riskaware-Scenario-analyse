Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.0 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 33.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is relatively close in the same lanelet. The relative velocity is significantly higher compared to the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 2
- **Time Risk reason**: Given the higher velocity of the obstacle, the TTC is relatively short, implying a need for quick maneuvering or braking.
- **Time safety score**: 2
- **Overall Risk score**: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 345.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet but positioned behind the ego vehicle and at a fair distance.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: The TTC is moderate, given the obstacle is behind and traveling slower than the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 350.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is located in a different lanelet and far from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The lack of motion and opposite lanelet orientation eliminate collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 358.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned significantly away from the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Very little movement, essentially static in another lanelet, resulting in no collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 367.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Far away in another lanelet with negligible relative movement.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The static position and orientation in a different lanelet present negligible risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 369.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Not in a direct path and located in a different lanelet.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Minimal velocity with insufficient acceleration toward the ego path.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 374.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Different lanelet, distant, and positioned off the path with minimal movement.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Nearly static position at a safe distance, posing negligible collision threat.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 378.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Slightly closer but in a different lanelet and moving away.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity with substantial acceleration not directed toward the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 380.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Position and motion indicate separation in lanelet and sufficient distance.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Substantial velocity yet deceleration and not on a collision course.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 383.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in a different lanelet and possessing a safe separation distance.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Despite accelerating, it remains distal in another lanelet.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

All obstacles are assessed as low risk or higher, with no immediate collision or extreme risk scenarios present.
