Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.0 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 33.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The distance between Ego and the obstacle at (516.16313, 922.86952) is calculated to be approximately 1.54 meters. This is a minimal distance considering the speed of the obstacle.
   - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.)
   - **Time Risk reason:** The relative speed towards Ego is significant, and with the given velocities, the time to collision is approximately 0.13 seconds (using (1.54 / (6.19 - 0.825))). This indicates a high probability of collision very soon.
   - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 345.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The distance between Ego and the obstacle at (510.24495, 908.90756) is approximately 8.44 meters, a safe distance for now.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.)
   - **Time Risk reason:** The relative speed calculation shows that the time to collision is around 0.24 seconds, but this is manageable due to sufficient distance.
   - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 350.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The distance to this stationary obstacle at (559.02466, 966.43998) is about 42.68 meters, which is a safe distance.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are far enough not to interfere.)
   - **Time Risk reason:** As this obstacle is stationary and not on a collision course, the TTC is not applicable here.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk: No significant collision risk.)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  
4. **Obstacle ID: 358.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The distance to the obstacle at (552.61883, 970.17062) is about 38.77 meters, indicating a safe situation.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are far enough not to interfere.)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Again, similar to the previous obstacle, it is stationary. Thus, no collision risk is presented.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk: No significant collision risk.)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 367.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle's distance is approximately 65.38 meters away, which signifies a safe distance.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk: No significant collision risk.)
   - **Time Risk reason:** The stationary nature has no concerning TTC; thus, it poses very little risk.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk: No significant collision risk.)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID: 369.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The distance to obstacle at (474.65146, 900.57371) measures about 43.64 meters, indicating minimal risk.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk: No significant collision risk.)
   - **Time Risk reason:** With a slight movement, TTC is negligible compared to Ego vehicle's speed.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk: No conflict in motion expected.)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

7. **Obstacle ID: 374.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Distance to this obstacle is about 62.62 meters, allowing a safe margin.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk: No significant collision risk.)
   - **Time Risk reason:** As it is virtually stationary, TTC is not an issue.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk: No collisions expected.)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

8. **Obstacle ID: 378.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** This moving obstacle is at a distance of around 18.02 meters which may seem close if moving towardtion is not accounted.
   - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk: Moderate collision risk; reactions needed.)
   - **Time Risk reason:** With a TTC of 1.29 seconds (using speed and distance), further evaluation of velocity is imperative.
   - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk: Close to collision; needs prompt attention.)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

9. **Obstacle ID: 380.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is approximately 15.08 meters away from Ego, indicating a close proximity.
   - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk: Close to the potential case for collision.)
   - **Time Risk reason:** With the speeds considered, TTC is around 0.87 seconds, which may lead to a collision if immediate attention isn't given.
   - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk: Close to collision; instruction promptness is necessary.)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

10. **Obstacle ID: 383.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle's distance from Ego is 13.9 meters - indicating a very close proximity.
   - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk: Its proximity imposes collision risk.)
   - **Time Risk reason:** The estimated 0.59 seconds TTC adds to the urgent action necessity.
   - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk: Potential collision is realistic if actions are delayed.)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)
