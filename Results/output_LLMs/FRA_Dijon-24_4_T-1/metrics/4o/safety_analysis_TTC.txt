Safety analysis for timestep 10.7 seconds:
```markdown
### Safety analysis for timestep 10.7 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30504
  - Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is left relative to the ego car, with a longitudinal collision distance of 0, indicating collision. The lateral distance to collision is 0.61.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 2
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 2 (wdominant = 0 for left direction, DSC = LongDSC * 0 + LatDSC * 1)
  - Time Risk Reason: The obstacle is aligned longitudinally with the ego car, resulting in a longitudinal time to collision of 0, indicating collision. The lateral time to collision is infinity, indicating no lateral risk.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 5 (wdominant = 0 for left direction, TSC = LongTSC * 0 + LatTSC * 1)
  - Overall Risk Score: 3 (Risk Score = 0.5 * DSC + 0.5 * TSC = 0.5 * 2 + 0.5 * 5 = 3.5)

- Obstacle ID: 30509
  - Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is front-right relative to the ego car, with significant longitudinal (8.42) and lateral (15.02) distances, indicating negligible collision risk.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5 (wdominant = 0.5 for front-right direction, DSC = LongDSC * 0.5 + LatDSC * 0.5)
  - Time Risk Reason: The obstacle poses no immediate collision threat with high longitudinal (15.88) time to collision; lateral time remains infinity, indicating no lateral risk.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 5 (wdominant = 0.5 for front-right direction, TSC = LongTSC * 0.5 + LatTSC * 0.5)
  - Overall Risk Score: 5 (Risk Score = 0.5 * DSC + 0.5 * TSC = 0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 5 = 5.0)
