Safety analysis for timestep 10.7 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 10.7 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30504
- Relative Direction: Left
- Distance Risk Reason: The longitudinal distance to collision is 0.0, indicating that there is an immediate risk of collision in the longitudinal direction. The lateral distance is 0.61, which suggests some space laterally, but with the longitudinal distance being zero, the primary risk comes from the head-on position.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
- Overall Distance Safety Score: DSC = 0 * 0 + 4 * (1 - 0) = 4
- Time Risk Reason: The longitudinal time to collision is 0.0, again indicating an immediate risk of collision. The lateral time to collision is infinity, meaning there is no risk laterally. Therefore, the immediate concern is due to the longitudinal aspect.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0  
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: TSC = 0 * 0 + 5 * (1 - 0) = 5
- Overall Risk Score: Risk Score = 0.5 * DSC + 0.5 * TSC = 0.5 * 4 + 0.5 * 5 = 4.5 (rounded down to 4)

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30509
- Relative Direction: Front-right
- Distance Risk Reason: The longitudinal distance to collision is 8.42, indicating a significant space in the longitudinal direction. The lateral distance to collision is 15.02, suggesting ample space laterally, posing minimal collision risk in both dimensions.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: DSC = 5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5 = 5
- Time Risk Reason: The longitudinal time to collision is 15.88, providing a safe margin against imminent collision, while the lateral time being infinity further solidifies the negligible risk.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5  
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: TSC = 5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5 = 5
- Overall Risk Score: Risk Score = 0.5 * DSC + 0.5 * TSC = 0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 5 = 5 (rounded down to 5)
