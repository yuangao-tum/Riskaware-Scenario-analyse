Safety analysis for timestep 10.7 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 10.7 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30504
- Relative Direction: Left
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal DTC is 0, indicating immediate collision risk, while lateral DTC (0.61) shows some space for lateral movement, but this does not mitigate the overall risk.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 0 * 0 + 4 * (1 - 0) = 4 => DSC = 4
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal TTC is 0 (indicating an immediate collision), while lateral TTC is infinite, leaving space for lateral maneuverability. 
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 0 * 0 + 5 * (1 - 0) = 5 => TSC = 5
- Overall Risk Score: 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 5 = 2.5 => Risk Score = 3

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30509
- Relative Direction: Front-right
- Distance Risk Reason: The longitudinal DTC of 8.42 and lateral DTC of 15.02 indicates a safe distance, minimizing collision risk in both directions.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5 * 0.5 + 5 * (1 - 0.5) = 5 => DSC = 5
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal TTC of 15.88 is adequate, and lateral TTC being infinite means there is no collision risk.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5 * 0.5 + 5 * (1 - 0.5) = 5 => TSC = 5
- Overall Risk Score: 0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 5 = 5 => Risk Score = 5
