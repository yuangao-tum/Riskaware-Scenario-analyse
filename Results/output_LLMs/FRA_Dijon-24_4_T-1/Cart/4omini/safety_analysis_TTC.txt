Safety analysis for the last timestep (10.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 10.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

**1. Obstacle ID: 30504.0**
- **Distance Risk reason:** 
  - Ego position: (-145.0044, -134.6761)
  - Obstacle position: (-147.3242, -131.4415)
  - The minimum distance (MDC) can be computed using Euclidean distance formula:
    \[ MDC = \sqrt{(-145.0044 - -147.3242)^2 + (-134.6761 - -131.4415)^2} \]
    \[ MDC \approx \sqrt{(2.3198)^2 + (-3.2346)^2} \approx \sqrt{5.3672 + 10.4596} \approx \sqrt{15.8268} \approx 3.97 \, \text{units} \]
  - Therefore, based on the position, this obstacle is relatively close and needs to be monitored.
- **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Time Risk reason:** 
  - Obstacle's velocity = 0.0, meaning it is stationary and does not pose an immediate threat.
  - Given the current speed of Ego (0.5302) and the proximity of the obstacle, TTC can be estimated as follows:
    \[ TTC = \frac{MDC}{\text{Velocity of Ego}} \]
    \[ TTC \approx \frac{3.97}{0.5302} \approx 7.48 \, \text{seconds} \]
  - This is a manageable time frame with proper reactions.
- **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)

- **Overall Risk score:** The Overall Risk score is the minimum of Distance and Time safety scores = min(3, 4) = 3 (Medium Risk).

**2. Obstacle ID: 30509.0**
- **Distance Risk reason:** 
  - Ego position: (-145.0044, -134.6761)
  - Obstacle position: (-128.7869, -121.2295)
  - Using the same distance formula as above:
    \[ MDC \approx \sqrt{(-145.0044 - -128.7869)^2 + (-134.6761 - -121.2295)^2} \]
    \[ MDC \approx \sqrt{(-16.2175)^2 + (-13.4466)^2} \approx \sqrt{262.0206 + 180.6581} \approx \sqrt{442.6787} \approx 21.05 \, \text{units} \]
  - This distance indicates that the obstacle is considerably far from Ego.
- **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Time Risk reason:** 
  - The obstacle is also stationary (velocity = 0.0).
  - The TTC calculation yields a similar estimation process as for the first obstacle:
    \[ TTC \approx \frac{21.05}{0.5302} \approx 39.7 \, \text{seconds} \]
  - This indicates no imminent collision risk.
- **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Overall Risk score:** The Overall Risk score is the minimum of Distance and Time safety scores = min(5, 5) = 5 (Negligible Risk).
