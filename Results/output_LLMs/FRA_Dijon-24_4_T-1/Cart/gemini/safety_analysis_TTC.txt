Safety analysis for the last timestep (10.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 10.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30504.0**
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (728.0) than the ego vehicle (1178.0).  The lateral distance suggests they are not on a direct collision course.  However, the longitudinal distance is relatively small, requiring further examination with TTC.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Without specific velocity and trajectory information for the obstacle, a precise TTC cannot be calculated. However, the obstacle's zero velocity and the ego vehicle's low velocity and negative acceleration suggest the risk is low, particularly given they are in different lanelets.  However, if the ego vehicle were to significantly change its trajectory towards the obstacle's lane, the risk could increase.  We assume, due to lack of information, that the obstacle remains stationary and ego continues decelerating.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30509.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is significantly further away than 30504.0 and is also in a different lanelet (39.0). The larger distance lowers the risk considerably.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Due to the larger distance and separate lanelets, the TTC is likely very high, posing negligible collision risk. Again, the obstacle is assumed stationary and ego continues on its path.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
