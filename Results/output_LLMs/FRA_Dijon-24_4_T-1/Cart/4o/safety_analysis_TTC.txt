Safety analysis for the last timestep (10.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 10.7 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30504.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: 
  - The obstacle is located in lanelet 728.0 while the ego vehicle is in lanelet 1178.0. Thus, they are not in the same lane. 
  - The Euclidean distance between the ego vehicle and the obstacle, calculated as √((-147.3242 + 145.0044)² + (-131.4415 + 134.6761)²) ≈ 3.218, indicates proximity but not an immediate threat since they are in different lanelets.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk, given they are not in the same lane and have a minimum distance with no lateral overlap)

- **Time Risk Reason**:
  - The velocity of the ego vehicle is 0.5302, moving away from the obstacle that has zero velocity. Due to the lane difference, TTC both longitudinally and laterally are not immediately threatening.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk, as there is no convergence in paths)

- **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk, considering both time and distance factors)

#### Obstacle ID: 30509.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**:
  - The obstacle is located in lanelet 39.0, which is different from the ego's lanelet. 
  - Calculating the Euclidean distance gives √((-128.7869 + 145.0044)² + (-121.2295 + 134.6761)²) ≈ 21.209, indicating a safe spatial margin.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk, significant distance and not in the same lane)

- **Time Risk Reason**:
  - With both the ego vehicle and the obstacle moving at different velocities and no overlap in paths or lanes, the time to collision is infinite or non-threatening.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk overall)

### Summary in JSON Format:
Since there are no obstacles with a collision risk score of 0 or an extreme risk score of 1, the JSON object will reflect null values:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

In summary, neither obstacle 30504.0 nor 30509.0 poses a significant collision risk to the ego vehicle in the analyzed scenario. They both exhibit negligible to low risk, showing a safe driving environment for the ego vehicle within the given parameters.
