### Safety analysis for timestep 10.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

**1. Obstacle ID: 30504.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is at a longitudinal distance of 0.0 m and a lateral distance of 0.61 m. Given that the longitudinal distance is zero, the ego vehicle is directly aligned with the obstacle, and the lateral distance is relatively small, indicating a very close proximity. 
- **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity longitudinally is -0.53 m/s, indicating that the ego vehicle is approaching the obstacle and reducing distance. The real distance to collision should be evaluated based on the longitudinal approach where the TTC can be calculated as:
  \[
  TTC_{\text{long}} = \frac{\text{DTClong}}{V_{\text{rel long}}} = \frac{0}{-0.53} = 0 \text{ seconds}
  \]
  Since the TTC is effectively instant, there is an immediate risk of collision.
  
- **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  
- **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

**2. Obstacle ID: 30509.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is at a longitudinal distance of 8.42 m and a lateral distance of -15.02 m. The longitudinal distance indicates a significant separation from the ego vehicle, while the lateral distance suggests that the obstacle is on the front-right. Although itâ€™s relatively far away, the significant longitudinal distance means no immediate collision threat is indicated.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity longitudinally is -0.53 m/s. Given the separation, TTC can be calculated as:
  \[
  TTC_{\text{long}} = \frac{8.42}{-0.53} \approx -15.9 \text{ seconds}
  \]
  This negative value indicates that even though the vehicle is moving toward the obstacle, they are not on a collision course within a realistic timeframe, suggesting that there is almost no risk of an impending collision.
  
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30504.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30504.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

### Final Remarks:
- Obstacle 30504.0 presents an extreme risk with both distance and time metrics leading to imminent collision scenarios, hence receiving a score of 1.
- Obstacle 30509.0 has a low risk due to the significant distance and time metrics indicating no immediate threat. 
- Overall, the evaluation suggests an urgent need to address the situation involving Obstacle 30504.0 to prevent an imminent collision.
