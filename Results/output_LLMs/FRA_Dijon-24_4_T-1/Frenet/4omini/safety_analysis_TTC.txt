### Safety analysis for timestep 10.7 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**Obstacle ID: 30504.0**  
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is positioned longitudinally at 0.0 m and laterally at 0.61 m from the ego vehicle. This means they are very close to each other with a minimal gap of 0.61 m laterally. The proximity suggests a higher risk due to the potential for a collision.  
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: The relative longitudinal velocity is -0.53 m/s, which indicates that the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle. Given a longitudinal distance of 0.0 m, this means immediate collision is highly likely. Therefore, the Time to Collision (TTC) is very low, indicating that urgent action is required.  
- **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)  

- **Overall Risk score**: The average of the distance and time scores is (2 + 1) / 2 = 1.5, rounded down to a score of 1 (Extreme Risk).

**Obstacle ID: 30509.0**  
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is positioned longitudinally at 8.42 m and laterally at -15.02 m, indicating it is to the front-right of the ego vehicle. While relatively far longitudinally, the lateral distance of -15.02 m poses less risk for collision as it is out of the vehicle's current trajectory. However, the longitudinal value indicates closeness in the forward trajectory, which must be monitored.  
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: The longitudinal relative velocity is again -0.53 m/s with a longitudinal distance of 8.42 m. To calculate TTC:  
  \[ 
  TTC = \frac{Distance}{Velocity} = \frac{8.42 \text{ m}}{-0.53 \text{ m/s}} \approx -15.9 \text{ seconds} 
  \]  
  Since TTC is negative and reflecting a distance to a moving obstacle that is likely closing in, immediate action is not critical but requires awareness.  
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: The average of distance and time scores is (3 + 3) / 2 = 3 (Medium Risk).

}
``` 

Despite the high concern with Obstacle 30504.0, there has been no immediate collision based on provided metrics; therefore, there are no obstacles in the collision or extreme risk categories for 30509.0. The situation is manageable, but attention should remain high on 30504.0 due to the extreme risk of collision.
