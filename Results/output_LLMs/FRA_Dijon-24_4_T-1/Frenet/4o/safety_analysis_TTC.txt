### Safety analysis for timestep 10.7 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30504.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is immediately adjacent to the left of the ego vehicle with a lateral distance of only 0.61 m and a longitudinal distance of 0.0 m. This proximity indicates an extreme risk of side collision.
- **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: Given the longitudinal relative velocity is -0.53 m/s (indicating they have a slight relative motion towards each other), and the lack of lateral movement, TTC is effectively zero, as they are already aligned. This represents an extreme risk situation.
- **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### Obstacle 30509.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is positioned front-right at a longitudinal distance of 8.42 m and a lateral distance of -15.02 m. The spatial separation suggests a low immediate collision risk, primarily because of the considerable lateral distance.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is advancing toward the ego car with a longitudinal velocity of -0.53 m/s. However, due to the lateral distance, the forward collision threat is minimized. The effective lateral position stabilizes this perception, providing sufficient time to react.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30504.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
```

The analysis shows Obstacle 30504.0 presents an extreme risk to the ego vehicle due to its immediate lateral proximity, inviting urgent intervention to prevent collision. In contrast, Obstacle 30509.0 currently presents a low risk due to its considerable lateral separation and manageable approach speed.
