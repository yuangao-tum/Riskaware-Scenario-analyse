### Safety analysis for timestep 10.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30504.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is very close laterally (0.61m) and longitudinally aligned (0m) with the ego vehicle, indicating a high risk of collision.  The lateral relative velocity is 0 m/s, but the lateral relative acceleration is 0.47 m/sÂ² suggesting a potential lateral movement towards the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** The longitudinal relative velocity is -0.53 m/s meaning the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle. With a longitudinal distance of 0m, a collision is imminent.
- **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30509.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is located at a relatively safe longitudinal distance (8.42m) and lateral distance (15.02m), but it's approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:**  While the longitudinal distance is currently safe, the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle with a relative longitudinal velocity of -0.53 m/s.  Without further information about the ego vehicle's motion, it's difficult to precisely determine the TTC, but it warrants attention. Lateral motion is not a concern.
- **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
