- Overall Risk Score: 5

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30685
- Relative Direction: Rear-right
- Distance Risk Reason: A longitudinal distance of 28.55 meters and a lateral distance of 0.6 meters suggest a minimal risk, with some proximity laterally.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 1
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 3
- Time Risk Reason: With infinity longitudinally and a relatively low TTC of 0.24 seconds laterally, indicates a moderate risk specifically laterally.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 1
- Overall Time Safety Score: 3
- Overall Risk Score: 3

### Obstacle Analysis:
