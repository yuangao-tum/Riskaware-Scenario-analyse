Safety analysis for timestep 9.8 seconds:
```plaintext
### Safety analysis for timestep 9.8 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 30681
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is very close in the longitudinal direction with DTClong = 0.22, immediate risk due to direction and proximity.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1  
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0
    - Time Risk Reason: Very low TTClong = 0.41 indicates an extreme risk of collision.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 1

    - Obstacle ID: 30682
    - Relative Direction: Rear-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: Obstacle is far longitudinally (DTClong = 59.67) and laterally (DTClat = 4.36) moving away longitudinally.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5
    - Time Risk Reason: No longitudinal TTC risk (TTClong = Infinity) and a high lateral TTC (TTClat = 57.81).
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 30683
    - Relative Direction: Rear-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: Obstacle is far in both longitudinal (DTClong = 26.86) and lateral (DTClat = 29.68) directions, moving away.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: No risk from TTC because both TTClong and TTClat are Infinity.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 30685
    - Relative Direction: Rear-right
    - Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is far longitudinally (DTClong = 28.55) but closer laterally (DTClat = 0.6).
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.0
    - Time Risk Reason: No longitudinal TTC risk due to Infinity; low lateral TTC (TTClat = 0.24) introduces high risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 1
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 3.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 4

    - Obstacle ID: 30686
    - Relative Direction: Rear-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: Obstacle is far in both directions, longitudinal (DTClong = 40.96) and lateral (DTClat = 3.86).
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5
    - Time Risk Reason: No risk from TTC because both TTClong and TTClat are Infinity.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 30687
    - Relative Direction: Rear-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is far longitudinally (DTClong = 72.66) and laterally (DTClat = 4.75), moving away.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5
    - Time Risk Reason: No longitudinal TTC risk; safe lateral TTC (TTClat = 53.93).
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 30688
    - Relative Direction: Rear-right
    - Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is far longitudinally (DTClong = 29.02) and laterally (DTClat = 9.17).
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: No longitudinal TTC risk; lateral TTC at a low risk level (TTClat = 6.62).
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 4
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5
    - Overall Risk Score: 5
