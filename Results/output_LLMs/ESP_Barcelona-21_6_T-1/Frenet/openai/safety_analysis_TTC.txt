### Safety analysis for timestep 9.8 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30681.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance is 0.22 m (very close), indicating an immediate risk of collision. The lateral distance is 0.0 m, providing no buffer.
   - **Distance safety score:** **1** (Extreme Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal relative velocity is -0.52 m/s, indicating that the gap is decreasing rapidly. The time to collision (TTC) is approximately 0.42 seconds (TTC = 0.22 m / 0.52 m/s).
   - **Time safety score:** **1** (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** **1** (Extreme Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30682.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance -59.67 m (safe), but laterally 4.36 m (moving toward the ego car). The longitudinal movement is moving away.
   - **Distance safety score:** **4** (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** With longitudinal velocity -0.91 m/s, the time to collision is (not applicable as longitudinally moving away). Laterally, it also shows no immediate collision. 
   - **Time safety score:** **4** (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** **4** (Low Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30683.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance -26.86 m (safe), lateral distance 29.68 m indicates a safe separation.
   - **Distance safety score:** **4** (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal velocity -3.41 m/s (moving away) creates no immediate collision threat. TTC is favorable.
   - **Time safety score:** **4** (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** **4** (Low Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 30685.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance -28.55 m (safe), lateral 0.6 m indicates some risk but manageable since distance is negative.
   - **Distance safety score:** **4** (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal relative speed of -3.16 m/s suggests it's moving away as well. No imminent collision.
   - **Time safety score:** **4** (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** **4** (Low Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 30686.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance -40.96 m (safe), lateral distance 3.86 m (no direct encroachment).
   - **Distance safety score:** **4** (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** With longitudinal speed -3.51 m/s (moving away), indicates safe TTC as no collision is anticipated.
   - **Time safety score:** **4** (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** **4** (Low Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID: 30687.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal -72.66 m (safe), lateral distance 4.75 m, indicating a secure distance with relative separation.
   - **Distance safety score:** **4** (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal speed -0.63 m/s implies it's moving away effectively, creating no risk of collision. 
   - **Time safety score:** **4** (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** **4** (Low Risk)

7. **Obstacle ID: 30688.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal -29.02 m (safe), lateral distance -9.17 m indicates proximity to the rear and aligned but still distant.
   - **Distance safety score:** **4** (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal speed -3.44 m/s shows it’s moving away; same with lateral–providing safety.
   - **Time safety score:** **4** (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** **4** (Low Risk)
