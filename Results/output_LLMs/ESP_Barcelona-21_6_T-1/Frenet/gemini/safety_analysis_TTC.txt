### Safety analysis for timestep 9.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30681.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is almost directly in front of the ego vehicle (0.22m longitudinally, 0m laterally). This indicates extreme risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 1
- **Time Risk reason:**  The relative longitudinal velocity is negative, meaning the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle. The small longitudinal distance and negative velocity indicate a very high likelihood of collision.  While the longitudinal acceleration is positive (meaning the obstacle might be braking), the current velocity and proximity are dominant factors.
- **Time safety score:** 1
- **Overall Risk score:** 1

- **Obstacle ID:** 30682.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located 59.67m behind and 4.36m to the left. Safe longitudinal distance, moderate lateral distance.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** Moving away longitudinally, reducing risk. Moving towards the ego car laterally but the distance is enough to react.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30683.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located 26.86m behind and 29.68m to the left. Safe distance in both directions.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** Moving away both longitudinally and laterally.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID:** 30685.0
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Located 28.55m behind and 0.6m to the right. Safe longitudinal distance, minimal lateral distance requiring attention.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** Moving away longitudinally, decreasing risk. Moving towards the ego vehicle laterally, increasing risk.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4


- **Obstacle ID:** 30686.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located 40.96m behind and 3.86m to the left. Safe distance.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** Moving away longitudinally and no lateral relative motion.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30687.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located 72.66m behind and 4.75m to the left. Safe distance.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** Moving away longitudinally, and slightly towards the ego vehicle laterally, but the large distance provides ample time to react.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID:** 30688.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located 29.02m behind and 9.17m to the right. Safe distance.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** Moving away longitudinally and towards the ego vehicle laterally, but with sufficient distance for reaction.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4
