### Safety analysis for timestep 9.8 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30681.0**
  - Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is immediately in front of the ego vehicle at a distance of 0.22 m, with no lateral offset.
  - Distance Safety Score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Time Risk Reason: Given the obstacle's longitudinal relative velocity is -0.52 m/s, and its position, the TTC is approximately 0.42 seconds. 
  - Time Safety Score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk Score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30682.0**
  - Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is at a distance of -59.67 m longitudinally and 4.36 m laterally in the rear-left. It's moving away longitudinally.
  - Distance Safety Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk Reason: The obstacle's motion away from the ego vehicle implies no impending collision threat.
  - Time Safety Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30683.0**
  - Distance Risk Reason: Positioned at -26.86 m longitudinally and 29.68 m laterally. It's moving away in both dimensions.
  - Distance Safety Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk Reason: As the relative motion is away from the ego vehicle, no immediate collision threat exists.
  - Time Safety Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30685.0**
  - Distance Risk Reason: Located -28.55 m longitudinally and -0.6 m laterally in the rear-right. The obstacle is moving away.
  - Distance Safety Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk Reason: With the obstacle moving both laterally and longitudinally away, the collision risk is minimal.
  - Time Safety Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30686.0**
  - Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is at -40.96 m longitudinally in the rear-left with no lateral relative motion.
  - Distance Safety Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk Reason: No collision threat due to rear longitudinal position and absence of lateral movement.
  - Time Safety Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30687.0**
  - Distance Risk Reason: This obstacle is at -72.66 m longitudinally and 4.75 m laterally in the rear-left, moving away.
  - Distance Safety Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk Reason: Moving both longitudinally and laterally away reduces any collision risk.
  - Time Safety Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30688.0**
  - Distance Risk Reason: Positioned at -29.02 m longitudinally and -9.17 m laterally in the rear-right, moving away longitudinally.
  - Distance Safety Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk Reason: Moving away in both dimensions ensures low collision risk.
  - Time Safety Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
