### Safety analysis for timestep 9.8: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID**: 30681.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance (0.22 m) is extremely close, indicating an imminent risk of collision.
   - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: With a relative velocity of -0.52 m/s, the time to collision is approximately 0.42 seconds (TTC_long = DTClong / -Vrel_long = 0.22 / 0.52).
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID**: 30682.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance (-59.67 m) indicates the obstacle is far behind the ego vehicle, thus not posing an immediate risk of collision.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity suggests that the obstacle is moving away and poses no threat to the ego vehicle.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID**: 30683.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance (-26.86 m) is safe; it indicates the obstacle is further away and poses no threat.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away and work shows no collision threat.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID**: 30685.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance (-28.55 m) indicates there's no immediate risk of collision.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity indicates some lateral motion but at a safe distance, thus no chance of collision currently.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID**: 30686.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance (-40.96 m) indicates a significant separation, which eliminates immediate risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away rapidly, qualifying it as no threat.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID**: 30687.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance (-72.66 m) indicates a safe distance from the ego vehicle, no risk of collision.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Movement away while being far reduces likelihood of collision.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

7. **Obstacle ID**: 30688.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance (-29.02 m) permits separation from the ego and diminishes risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: It's also moving away, thus confirming it poses no concern.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
