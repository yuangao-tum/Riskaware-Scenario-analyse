Safety analysis for the last timestep (9.8 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 9.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise lane boundaries, obstacle dimensions, and ego vehicle dimensions aren't provided,  I'm making some simplifications for this analysis.  I'll primarily use Euclidean distance as a proxy for both longitudinal and lateral distances.  A more robust analysis would require detailed lane information and object shapes.  I'll also assume a collision is imminent if the distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle is less than a threshold (let's assume 2 meters for this example), which represents the combined size of both vehicles. Time to collision will be based on current velocities, which is an estimation assuming no changes in their velocities.
I define Overall Risk Score as the minimum score between time safety score and distance safety score.

**### Obstacle Analysis:**

- **Obstacle ID: 30681.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is in the same lanelet (196) as the ego vehicle.  The Euclidean distance between them is relatively small (~3.7m). This poses a high risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Both vehicles are moving in a similar direction with similar velocities.  TTC depends on their relative velocities and the small distance between them. Considering the small distance and the similar velocities, and accelerations, TTC might be short.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30682.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (2888). The Euclidean distance is relatively large (~52.2m).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The vehicles are in different lanelets and moving away.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30683.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (59). The distance is ~45.8m.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Given the distance and different lanes, TTC is high.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30685.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (2784). The distance is ~26.7m.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The distance is moderate, and they are in different lanelets.  TTC is likely moderate.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 30686.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (192). The distance is ~40.6m.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary, and the ego vehicle is moving.  TTC depends on the ego vehicle's trajectory, but the distance provides a buffer.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


- **Obstacle ID: 30687.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (190). The distance is ~63.2m.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The large distance and different lanelets imply a high TTC.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


- **Obstacle ID: 30688.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (53). The distance is ~21.5m.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The distance is moderate, and they are in different lanelets, suggesting a moderate TTC.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
