Safety analysis for the last timestep (9.8 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 9.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30681.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: The minimum distance to this obstacle needs to be evaluated. The ego vehicle is positioned at (-232.0244, 337.3271) while obstacle 30681 is at (-228.572, 334.104). The lateral distance is 3.4524 and the longitudinal distance is 3.5252.
    - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - **Time Risk reason**: The ego vehicle has a velocity of 3.5081 m/s and the obstacle has a velocity of 2.9874 m/s. The relative velocity towards the obstacle is \(3.5081 - 2.9874 = 0.5207\). The Time to Collision (TTC) is calculated as \(TTC = D/v_{relative} = 3.5252/0.5207 â‰ˆ 6.77\) seconds.
    - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30682.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is at a significant distance (-274.8609, 385.4935), resulting in a larger separation from the ego vehicle. The lateral distance exceeds 40 units.
    - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - **Time Risk reason**: Given the increased distance, and the speed of both vehicles, there is little risk of collision. Thus the TTC is extensive.
    - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30683.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Calculated distance is also significant enough. The coordinates show that it is more than 10 meters away.
    - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - **Time Risk reason**: Similar reasoning applies; TTC remains substantial; no critical risk level.
    - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30685.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at a considerable distance, its separation remains acceptable with a gap larger than 10 meters.
    - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - **Time Risk reason**: The low speed and distance imply that there's no immediate threat, yielding a long TTC.
    - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30686.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is stationary at the coordinates (-261.519, 372.3608), resulting in a safe distance from the ego vehicle.
    - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - **Time Risk reason**: With a speed of 0, it poses no risk for collision.
    - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30687.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is positioned at a good distance relative to the ego vehicle with more than 20 meters away.
    - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - **Time Risk reason**: With a low relative velocity with respect to the ego vehicle, the TTC is still large and non-critical.
    - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30688.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance is virtually safe, exceeding required margins.
    - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - **Time Risk reason**: Same reasoning. There's sufficient time before any potential crossing occurs.
    - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Summary in JSON Format: 
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
``` 

In conclusion, there are no obstacles with a collision risk (Overall Risk Score of 0) or extreme risk (Overall Risk Score of 1) in the scenario. The identified obstacles present a medium to negligible risk situation, with the majority being at a very low risk of collision.
