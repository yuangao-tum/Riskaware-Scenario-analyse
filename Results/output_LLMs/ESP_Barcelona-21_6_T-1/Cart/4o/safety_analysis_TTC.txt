Safety analysis for the last timestep (9.8 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 9.8: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30681.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and at a close proximity. Given the lateral distance is small, the risk is increased.
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High risk due to the close proximity in the same lanelet)
- **Time Risk reason**: The velocity difference between the ego vehicle and the obstacle is small, suggesting a limited Time to Collision if paths remain aligned.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium risk with manageable reactions)
- **Overall Risk score**: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 30682.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is located in a different lanelet and is relatively far in both lateral and longitudinal directions.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity and distance indicate no immediate collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30683.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Despite being in a different lanelet, it is farther away from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low risk, manageable as it is not on a collision path)
- **Time Risk reason**: With a different orientation and moderate distance, there is no significant TTC risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30685.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet with a wide separation in coordinates.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low risk due to separation by lanelets)
- **Time Risk reason**: The orientation and velocity suggest no collision course in addition to a healthy distance.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30686.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle remains stationary and in a different lanelet, implying minimal immediate risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk, stationary and distant)
- **Time Risk reason**: No TTC concern as it is stationary and off-path.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30687.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in another lanelet and far off from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Harmless velocity and trajectory alignment, reducing any immediate collision probability.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30688.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is placed distinctively apart in a different lanelet.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The presence of a larger lateral clearance reduces urgency, aligning with a similarly low TTC risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

The analysis indicates no immediate collision or extreme risk obstacles. Most obstacles are in different lanelets, reducing collision probability, with one high-risk obstacle due to proximity and same lane positioning. All identified risks are manageable within existing conditions.
