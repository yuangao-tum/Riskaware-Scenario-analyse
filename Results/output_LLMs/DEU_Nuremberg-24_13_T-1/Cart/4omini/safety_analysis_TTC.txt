Safety analysis for the last timestep (8.4 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 8.4 seconds: 
Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30703.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is located in a different lanelet and is stationary, which reduces the collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Similar to the distance assessment, as the obstacle is stationary, the time to collision is not applicable.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30704.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is approaching with a higher velocity and is in close proximity.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The calculating TTC shows a potential collision given the speed and relative positioning: close relative paths.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 30705.0
- Distance Risk reason: Stationary and located in a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Stationary, less risk with no fast approach.

- Overall Risk score: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30706.0
- Distance Risk reason: Approaching at a high speed, may cross into the ego vehicle's path.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: High speed and potential crossing path creates a dangerous situation.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 30707.0
- Distance Risk reason: It is rapidly approaching in the same lanelet. 
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: High speed of approach means TTC is critically low, indicating imminent collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

#### Obstacle ID: 30708.0
- Distance Risk reason: Positioned far away from the ego vehicle and moving in a different direction.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No immediate risk of collision due to distance and speed.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30709.0
- Distance Risk reason: Stationary and in a different lanelet, negligible risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: No motion, inherently safe.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30710.0
- Distance Risk reason: Another stationary obstacle in a separate lanelet. 
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Stationary, creating little to no time risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30711.0
- Distance Risk reason: It is moving at a moderate speed toward the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The total speed vector varies regarding collision-time calculations.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30712.0
- Distance Risk reason: Slow moving towards the ego vehicle but not directly in the way.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Slow movement with low risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30715.0
- Distance Risk reason: Approaching quickly, presenting collision concern.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The high velocity creates a potential collision pathway.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 30716.0
- Distance Risk reason: Relative movement towards the ego vehicle indicates risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Speed makes immediate threats more likely.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 30718.0
- Distance Risk reason: Approaching at significant speed in the same lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: This could yield a reduction in TTC.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 30719.0
- Distance Risk reason: Very fast and could intersect ego paths.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: The combination of distance and speed indicates that immediate action is needed to avoid collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

#### Obstacle ID: 30720.0
- Distance Risk reason: Stationary, in a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: No threat due to no movement towards ego.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30721.0
- Distance Risk reason: Moving fast towards ego path.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Potentially dangerous as time to collision shortens rapidly.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30722.0
- Distance Risk reason: Moving in a separate direction, lower concern.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: On trajectory to miss the egoâ€™s path.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30723.0
- Distance Risk reason: Moving quickly, indicating a threshold risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: High speed suggests potential crossing.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2
