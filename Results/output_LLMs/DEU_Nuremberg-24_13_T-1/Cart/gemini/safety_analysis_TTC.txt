Safety analysis for the last timestep (8.4 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 8.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories and dimensions of vehicles are not provided, I'm making some simplifying assumptions for this analysis:

* **Point Objects:** Vehicles are treated as point objects for distance calculations.  A more accurate assessment would require vehicle dimensions and shapes.
* **Constant Velocity and Acceleration (Short Term):**  For TTC calculations, I'm assuming constant velocity and acceleration over a short time horizon.  This is reasonable for near-term risk assessment but less accurate for longer predictions.
* **Lanelet Information as Proxy for Trajectory:**  Lanelet information helps determine general direction and potential conflicts. However, precise future trajectories within the lanelet are unknown, making accurate long-term TTC and MDC difficult to determine.
* **Thresholds for Risk Scores:**  Specific thresholds for TTC and MDC to determine risk scores would ideally be calibrated based on the autonomous vehicle's capabilities (braking performance, etc.). I'm using reasonable estimates, but these should be adjusted based on real-world testing and safety requirements.

**Calculations and Reasoning Examples (Obstacles 30716 and 30718):**

* **Obstacle 30716:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet (1930) as the ego vehicle.  It is moving with a higher velocity and negative acceleration and is behind the ego vehicle.  Therefore, TTC is likely high, and MDC is moderately high but the obstacle is catching up with the ego vehicle. Risk is classified as Low.

* **Obstacle 30718:** This obstacle is in lanelet 1049, which may or may not intersect with the ego vehicle's intended path. Its location and velocity suggest a potential crossing trajectory. A more detailed map and planned trajectory of the ego vehicle are needed for a precise TTC calculation. I will estimate risk based on distance and rough assumptions about trajectories, likely Medium or High depending on the potential intersection point.
