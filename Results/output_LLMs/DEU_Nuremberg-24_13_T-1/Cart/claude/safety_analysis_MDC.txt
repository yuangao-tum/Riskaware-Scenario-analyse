Safety analysis for the last timestep (8.4 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario for potential collisions.

Key observations:
1. Ego vehicle is in lanelet 613.0/1930.0 moving at around 4.4 m/s
2. Several obstacles in proximity, particularly examining ones in same or adjacent lanelets

Detailed Safety Analysis:

1. Obstacle 30716:
- Distance Risk: High risk as it's in the same lanelet (613.0) with close lateral distance
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk: Moderate as relative velocities suggest potential conflict
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 2

2. Obstacle 30715:
- Distance Risk: Medium risk due to adjacent lanelet position
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk: Low as trajectories not directly conflicting
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

3. Obstacle 30721:
- Distance Risk: Medium risk due to proximity in adjacent lanelet
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk: Medium due to converging paths
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

4. Most other obstacles are either:
- In different lanelets with sufficient separation
- Moving in different directions
- Have adequate spacing and time margins

Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Key Safety Findings:
1. No immediate collision risks detected (no score of 0 or 1)
2. Closest interaction is with Obstacle 30716, but maintaining safe separation
3. Most obstacles maintain safe distances and trajectories relative to ego vehicle
4. The ego vehicle's moderate speed (4.4 m/s) provides good control margin
5. No obstacles show extreme risk patterns requiring immediate intervention

The scenario shows proper vehicle spacing and manageable risk levels, though continued monitoring of Obstacle 30716 is recommended due to shared lanelet occupancy.
