### Safety analysis for timestep 8.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**General Considerations:**

* **TTC Calculation:** TTC is calculated as DTC / Vrel.  If Vrel is positive (obstacle moving away), TTC is considered infinite (no collision risk). If Vrel is close to zero, TTC calculation becomes unstable and requires careful consideration based on acceleration and distance.
* **MDC Calculation:**  In this scenario, with limited information, we approximate MDC using the current DTC.  A more accurate assessment would require trajectory prediction.
* **Overall Risk:** The overall risk score is determined by the lower of the distance and time risk scores, reflecting the most imminent potential hazard.
