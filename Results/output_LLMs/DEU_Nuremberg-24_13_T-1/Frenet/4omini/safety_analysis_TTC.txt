### Safety analysis for timestep 8.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 30703.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of 29.35 m and lateral distance of -70.45 m suggests it is far away laterally but relatively close longitudinally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity of -4.34 m/s longitudinally indicates that the obstacle is approaching. TTC calculations yield approximately 6.76 seconds until a collision occurs (TTC = distance/velocity = 29.35 / 4.34).
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30704.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal 40.74 m and lateral -31.5 m; itâ€™s further away longitudinally but approaching from the side.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away longitudinally (0.8 m/s) but approaching laterally (5.28 m/s). The TTC for lateral motion is low; potential collision is expected laterally sooner.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30705.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of 20.89 m implies a potentially closer threat longitudinally while being further laterally (-81.06 m).
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC estimates around 4.81 seconds; hazard persists but is manageable.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30706.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of 68.17 m indicates a clear separation longitudinally but presents less distance laterally (-83.68 m).
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Approaching longitudinally with a negative relative velocity of -2.35 m/s suggests a TTC of about 29.0 seconds. It poses a minimal risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30707.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinally 34.54 m and laterally -92.56 m signify a reasonably close outlook ahead but comfortable spacing laterally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Estimated TTC around 12.56 seconds. Still requires active monitoring due to longitudinal approach.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30710.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance 36.98 m, with a closer approach laterally (-86.23 m); it remains a manageable tactical consideration due to distance.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinally approaching at -4.34 m/s, and thus TTC yields about 8.52 seconds.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30711.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Exact longitudinal alignment (0.0 m) indicates a critical position in my trajectory, laterally -57.44 m.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Laterally approaching with a high velocity of 1.26 m/s, estimating a severe collision risk in just moments.
  - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30716.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Exact longitudinal alignment (0.0 m) and close proximity laterally (-0.24 m) represent an immediate concern.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The lateral approach of 5.14 m/s indicates an immediate collision course; estimated collision imminently.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
