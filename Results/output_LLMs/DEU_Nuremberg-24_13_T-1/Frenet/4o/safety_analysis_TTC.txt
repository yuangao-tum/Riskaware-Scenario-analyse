### Safety analysis for timestep 8.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30703.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is 29.35 m towards the ego car. The lateral distance of -70.45 m puts it in a different path. Longitudinal relative velocity is negative, indicating closing in.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Minimal risk due to lateral separation)
- **Time Risk reason**: Approximate TTC_long: 29.35 / 4.34 ≈ 6.76 seconds and TTC_lat: Undefined due to lack of lateral velocity.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Moderate time to collision time longitudinally, but no lateral risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle 30704.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned longitudinally at 40.74 m away and with a lateral distance of -31.5 m. Relative velocity indicates it's moving away longitudinally but moving laterally towards the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Affected by lateral approach)
- **Time Risk reason**: High TTC due to moving away longitudinally but approaching laterally, exact TTC_lat would depend highly on dynamics.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Moderate risk due to conflicting velocities)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle 30705.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Distance is closing in longitudinally but no lateral motion. Positioned further out at a lateral distance of -81.06 m.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Low risk due to lateral offset)
- **Time Risk reason**: Approximate TTC_long: 20.89 / 4.34 ≈ 4.81 seconds.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Moderate risk given longitudinal closing)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3
