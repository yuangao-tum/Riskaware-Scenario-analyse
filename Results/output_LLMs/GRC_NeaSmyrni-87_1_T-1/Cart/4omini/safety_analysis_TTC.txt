Safety analysis for the last timestep (0.4 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 0.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 20039.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The ego vehicle is at (-61.0446, 30.4316) and the obstacle at (-64.7112, 31.5258). The minimum distance involves direct lateral movement, with an estimated closest approach of approximately 4.36 meters. Given their positions, the distance is categorized as very close, especially in the direction of the ego's motion.
  - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is stationary (velocity = 0). Given the ego's velocity of 5.8321 m/s, TTC is approximately 0.745 seconds for longitudinal and around 0.4 seconds laterally due to the ego vehicle's orientation. This indicates a strong likelihood of collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20044.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Located at (−4.8716, 0.078) and the ego vehicle at (-61.0446, 30.4316) poses a significant distance of around 66.50 meters. There is no immediate risk of lateral movement affecting the trajectory.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The velocity of the obstacle is 1.6447 m/s, but with substantial distance and the ego movement direction, there is no risk of collision. TTC is large enough to be considered safe.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20045.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** With coordinates (9.0791, 1.2465), this obstacle is far away from the ego vehicle and poses no risk of collision due to distance over 90 meters.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle's slow speed (0.0524 m/s) and considerable distance mean that the TTC is extremely high with no collision risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20047.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle at (16.6871, 2.9058) has a significant distance from the ego vehicle, estimated around 76.38 meters, keeping the risk levels minimal.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is stationary with zero velocity, thus a very high TTC renders it non-threatening.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20048.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned at (19.6301, -0.6508), this obstacle is also quite distant from the ego vehicle, about 79.49 meters.
    - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - **Time Risk reason:** Given the capability of the ego vehicle to maintain distance and the slow-moving obstacle (0.0 m/s), there’s no immediate risk.
    - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20050.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is at (-44.3057, -37.1946), and the ego vehicle is significantly far from it with a distance of approximately 77.78 meters.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Although the obstacle has a speed of 13.7066 m/s, its trajectory is not intersecting with that of the ego vehicle.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
