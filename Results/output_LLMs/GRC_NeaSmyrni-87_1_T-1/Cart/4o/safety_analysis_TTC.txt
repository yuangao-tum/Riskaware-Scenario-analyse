Safety analysis for the last timestep (0.4 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 0.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 20039.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is in the same lanelet (117.0) as the ego vehicle, indicating potential direct collision risk, but it is stationary with velocity 0. The relative distance is very close.
- **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme risk due to close proximity and static nature)
- **Time Risk reason**: Due to the obstacle being stationary and in the same lanelet, Time to Collision (TTC) is very low.
- **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme risk due to nearly immediate collision possibility)
- **Overall Risk score**: 1

#### Obstacle ID: 20044.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located far from the ego vehicle in a different lanelet (4974.0); no immediate risk due to separation.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Moving slowly and lateral separation suggests no risk of collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20045.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned far from the ego vehicle in a different lanelet (802.0); no immediate risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity and lateral separation prevent collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20047.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Situated in a different lanelet (5072.0), far away from the ego vehicle; no immediate risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Stationary and far enough not to pose a collision threat.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20048.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in a different lanelet (4973.0) with a sufficient distance from the ego vehicle; no threat perceived.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Stationary and too far to present a collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20050.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Despite higher velocity, it is located far in another lanelet (804.0), indicating no immediate danger.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Fast-moving, but the directional and lanelet separation ensure no collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20039.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

This evaluation indicates that the primary concern is the obstacle 20039.0, which shares the lanelet with the ego vehicle and is in close proximity, posing an extreme collision risk. Other obstacles are safely distanced or moving in different trajectories with negligible risk.
