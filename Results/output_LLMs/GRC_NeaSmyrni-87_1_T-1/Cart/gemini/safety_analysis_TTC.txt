Safety analysis for the last timestep (0.4 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 0.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories, shapes, and sizes of the vehicles are not provided, we will make some simplifying assumptions for this analysis. We will treat vehicles as points and primarily focus on their positions, velocities, and headings to estimate TTC and MDC.  A more accurate assessment would require detailed vehicle dimensions and predicted trajectories.  We'll assume a lane width of approximately 3.7 meters.  Lateral TTC and MDC will be calculated based on lane boundaries if vehicles are in different lanes. For TTC calculations, negative values indicate objects moving away from each other.

**Calculations explanation using Obstacle 20039 as example**
Obstacle 20039 and ego are both in lane 117.
DTClong: Distance between ego position (-61.0446, 30.4316) and obstacle position (-64.7112, 31.5258) is calculated using the distance formula. Then take the absolute value.
DTClat: Since they are in the same lane, the lateral distance is approximately the difference in their y values.
TTClong: Since the obstacle is stationary (velocity = 0), TTClong calculation uses only the ego velocity (5.8321 m/s) and the DTClong = sqrt((-61.0446+64.7112)^2 + (30.4316-31.5258)^2) = 3.7851m
TTClong = DTClong/Ego_velocity = 3.7851/5.8321 = 0.6490
TTClat: Same reasoning as TTClong: TTClat = DTClat/Ego_velocity = abs(30.4316 - 31.5258)/5.8321 = 0.1876.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 20039**
- Distance Risk reason: Both DTClong (3.7851m) and DTClat (1.0942m) are small, indicating close proximity within the same lane.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: TTClong (0.65s) is very short, indicating high risk of longitudinal collision. TTClat (0.19s) is also extremely short, indicating imminent lateral collision if ego attempts to swerve.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20044**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located in a different lane (4974). Relatively large DTClong and DTClat.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  TTC calculations irrelevant due to different lanes. 
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20045**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lane (802). Relatively large DTClong and DTClat.
