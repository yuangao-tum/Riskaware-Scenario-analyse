### Safety analysis for timestep 0.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 20039.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The ego vehicle is at 0.0 m in longitudinal distance and 0.0 m in lateral distance from this obstacle, indicating an exact impact situation.
  - Distance safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC cannot be calculated accurately since the ego vehicle is already in collision with the obstacle.
  - Time safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **1** (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20044.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance is -58.0 m and lateral distance is 11.41 m. This obstacle is rear-left and moving away, creating no immediate collision risk.
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: As this obstacle is moving away with a relative velocity of -4.42 m/s longitudinally, it has a positive distance, minimizing risk of collision.
  - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **4** (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20045.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Positioned at -71.03 m longitudinally and 6.3 m laterally and is also moving away, presenting negligible risk.
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: As it is moving away longitudinally, it also minimizes the likelihood of collision significantly.
  - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **4** (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20047.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: At a longitudinal distance of -77.85 m, and 2.53 m laterally, also presenting no immediate threat since it is moving away.
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The object is also moving away, ensuring that the collision risk remains minimal.
  - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **4** (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20048.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Similar position at -81.69 m longitudinally and 5.1 m laterally, and is moving away, presenting no imminent threat.
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The object is moving away with no immediate risk factors projected to change.
  - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **4** (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20050.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: With a longitudinal distance of -30.87 m and a lateral distance of 58.4 m, it is positioned well enough away from potential collision despite the relatively closer longitudinal measure.
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away laterally, which again minimizes the risk of collision.
  - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **4** (Low Risk)
