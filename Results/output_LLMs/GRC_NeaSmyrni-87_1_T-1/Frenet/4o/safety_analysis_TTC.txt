### Safety analysis for timestep 0.4: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 20039.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is at longitudinal 0.0 m and lateral 0.0 m, directly in the collision path of the ego car.
- **Distance safety score**: 0
- **Time Risk reason**: Immediate collision with 0 time to take evasive action.
- **Time safety score**: 0
- **Overall Risk score**: 0

#### Obstacle ID: 20044.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located rear-left, with a safe distance (longitudinal -58.0 m and lateral 11.41 m).
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away both longitudinally and laterally, providing negligible risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 4.5

#### Obstacle ID: 20045.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located rear-left at a longitudinal distance of -71.03 m and lateral of 6.3 m, far enough to avoid collision.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away, thus providing sufficient time to react.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 4.5

#### Obstacle ID: 20047.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at the rear-left with a longitudinal distance of -77.85 m and lateral distance of 2.53 m, not in immediate collision path.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: No lateral motion combined with moving away longitudinally indicates negligible collision time risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 4.5

#### Obstacle ID: 20048.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is at a safe longitudinal distance of -81.69 m and lateral distance of 5.1 m.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Negligible collision risk as the obstacle moves away longitudinally.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 4.5

#### Obstacle ID: 20050.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Considerable safe distance with longitudinal distance of -30.87 m and lateral distance of 58.4 m.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: No collision risk, moving rapidly away both longitudinally and laterally.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5
