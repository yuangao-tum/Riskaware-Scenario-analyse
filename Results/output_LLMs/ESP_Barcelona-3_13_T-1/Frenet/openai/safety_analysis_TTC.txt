To analyze the provided scenario, let's first extract relevant information for each obstacle, calculate the Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC), and evaluate the risks associated with each. 

### Safety analysis for timestep 4.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Definitions:**
- **TTC Longitudinal (TTC_long)**: Calculated using the formula \(TTC = \frac{D}{V}\) where \(D\) is the longitudinal distance (DTClong), and \(V\) is the relative velocity (Vrel_long).
- **TTC Lateral (TTC_lat)**: Similar formula approach for lateral distances.
  
### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30749**
