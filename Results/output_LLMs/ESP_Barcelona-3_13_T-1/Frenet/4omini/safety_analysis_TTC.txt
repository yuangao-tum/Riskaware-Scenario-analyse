### Safety analysis for timestep 4.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30749.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance to the obstacle is 43.14 m longitudinally and 14.23 m laterally. This presents a significant gap between the ego vehicle and the obstacle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is -0.87 m/s longitudinally; however, the distance is sufficient to allow reaction time. TTC calculated as Distance / Relative Velocity = 43.14 / 0.87 = 49.7 seconds.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30750.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Real distance is 16.93 m longitudinally and -1.9 m laterally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC calculated as 16.93 / 0.87 = 19.5 seconds provides ample time to react.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  
- **Obstacle ID**: 30751.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Distance is 25.64 m longitudinally and 14.07 m laterally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC calculated as 25.64 / 0.87 = 29.4 seconds. No immediate concern.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30752.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Real distance is 43.01 m longitudinally and 29.85 m laterally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC calculated as 43.01 / 0.87 = 49.5 seconds.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30754.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: 16.96 m longitudinally and exactly aligned laterally at 0 m.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk) due to no lateral distance.
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC calculated as 16.96 / 0.87 = 19.5 seconds, which indicates a collision is imminent.
  - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30755.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: 8.02 m longitudinally and 1.88 m laterally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk) due to the close proximity.
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away longitudinally, but TTC cannot be calculated accurately due to proximity; hence risk is immediate.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30764.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Direct collision with 0.0 m distance.
  - **Distance safety score**: 0 (Collision).
  - **Time Risk reason**: Immediate collision situation, no time to react.
  - **Time safety score**: 0 (Collision)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 0 (Collision)
