### Safety analysis for timestep 4.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**General Notes:**  Since constant velocity/acceleration is assumed for TTC calculations, these values are estimates.  A negative TTC indicates the objects are moving away from each other longitudinally.  Obstacles with lateral movement towards the ego pose a risk even if they are moving away longitudinally. The overall risk score is determined by the lower of the distance and time risk scores.


- **Obstacle ID: 30749.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  43.14m longitudinal and 14.23m lateral distance are safe.
