Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.6 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories, dimensions of vehicles, and lanelet geometries are not provided,  I will make reasonable assumptions for demonstration. I'll primarily rely on Euclidean distance for risk assessment, acknowledging that this is a simplification.  A comprehensive analysis would require more data. I'm assuming a safety "bubble" around the ego vehicle:  any encroachment within this bubble, especially with low TTC, increases risk.

**Calculations (Illustrative):**

I will calculate approximate distances between the ego vehicle and obstacles. For TTC, a crude estimate will be based on closing velocities (which would require vector calculations in a full analysis). I'm assuming TTC becomes critical if under 2 seconds and very concerning if under 5 seconds.
