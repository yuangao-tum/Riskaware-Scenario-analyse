Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.6 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.6 seconds:
Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30749**
  - Distance Risk reason: The position of this obstacle is relatively far from the ego vehicle with a small angle between their velocities, reducing collision likelihood.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary, and the ego vehicle is moving away from it, indicating no immediate danger.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 4
  
- **Obstacle ID: 30750**
  - Distance Risk reason: The ego vehicle is moving in the general direction of this stationary obstacle, but it maintains a significant distance.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Similar to above, no movement indicates no immediate risk of collision.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30751**
  - Distance Risk reason: The ego vehicle has a considerable distance from this stationary obstacle, with no imminent trajectory conflict.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: No movement from the obstacle combined with ego vehicle's trajectory implies no collision risk.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30752**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is moving but is at a safe distance from the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Complex movement dynamics mean that the risk of collision remains low, despite the obstacle's velocity.
  - Time safety score: 4
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30753**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary and located away from the ego vehicle path, reducing collision risk.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: With no movement from the obstacle, there’s no time-based risk of collision.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30754**
  - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is stationary and positioned far from the ego vehicle, indicating low threat.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Also stationary, highlighting reduced collision risk.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30755**
  - Distance Risk reason: The moving obstacle is further away and has a different trajectory, leading to minimal concern.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: The dynamics between the velocity and distance suggest no immediate threat.
  - Time safety score: 4
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30756**
  - Distance Risk reason: The moving obstacle is at a somewhat closer position than others, but still maintains a detectable distance.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: The movement direction does not imply a convergence towards the ego vehicle.
  - Time safety score: 4
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30757**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary and located at a considerable distance from the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: No movement from this object, so collision risk is negligible.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30758**
  - Distance Risk reason: This stationary obstacle keeps a safe distance relative to the moving ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Again, there are no immediate movements indicating risk.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30759**
  - Distance Risk reason: The moving obstacle is closer compared to others but not posing significant risk due to trajectory differences.
  - Distance safety score: 3
  - Time Risk reason: The obstacle’s velocity creates some concern but still not enough to indicate immediate risk.
  - Time safety score: 3
  - Overall Risk score: 3
    
- **Obstacle ID: 30760**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle but starts from a sufficient distance.
  - Distance safety score: 3
  - Time Risk reason: Time calculations indicate a manageable risk provided timely reactions are in place.
  - Time safety score: 3
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30761**
  - Distance Risk reason: While this obstacle is moving and it’s closer, its trajectory suggests it won't intercept the ego vehicle's path.
  - Distance safety score: 3
  - Time Risk reason: The risk level seems moderate with given velocities but manageable reactions can be initiated to avoid any risk.
  - Time safety score: 3
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30762**
  - Distance Risk reason: Closer moving obstacle may imply a collision course but is still at a distance worth noting.
  - Distance safety score: 2
  - Time Risk reason: Given its speed and heading, immediate conflict might arise if the ego vehicle's trajectory does not alter.
  - Time safety score: 2
  - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30763**
  - Distance Risk reason: Similar to previous obstacles, significant movement requires caution yet they remain at a distance.
  - Distance safety score: 2
  - Time Risk reason: The trajectory could line up negatively depending on ego vehicle maneuvering; it’s a close assessment.
  - Time safety score: 2
  - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30764**
  - Distance Risk reason: With a higher velocity present, the positioning becomes a large concern.
  - Distance safety score: 2
  - Time Risk reason: Fast approach shrinks the time buffer; prompt attention is necessary.
  - Time safety score: 2
  - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30766**
  - Distance Risk reason: Closer position of a fast-moving obstacle could lead to an immediate conflict unless corrective actions are taken quickly.
  - Distance safety score: 1
  - Time Risk reason: Rapid approach may cause imminent collision if trajectory and speed aren't adjusted soon.
  - Time safety score: 1
  - Overall Risk score: 1
