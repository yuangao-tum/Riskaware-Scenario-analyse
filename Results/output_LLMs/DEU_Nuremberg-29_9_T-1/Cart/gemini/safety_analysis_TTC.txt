Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.6 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.6: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories and shapes of obstacles and ego vehicle are not provided,  I will make some general assumptions for demonstration purposes.  I will assume a rectangular bounding box for all vehicles and  use a simplified TTC calculation based on current velocities and positions. A more robust analysis would involve predicted trajectories,  consideration of vehicle shapes, and detailed motion models.  I will analyze both longitudinal and lateral TTC (TTClong, TTClat) and distances (DTClong, DTClat) where applicable and based on the available information.

**Ego Vehicle Information:**
* Position: (-398.8776, 225.2258)
* Orientation: 0.8623765542383046 radians
* Velocity: 3.5673 m/s
* Acceleration: -2.1349 m/sÂ²
* Lanelet: 992.0



### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30782**
- Distance Risk reason:  The obstacle is in a different lanelet (269) and laterally separated.  The longitudinal distance is moderately close but the relative velocities suggest they are moving apart.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The lateral and longitudinal TTC suggest no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30783**
- Distance Risk reason:  The obstacle is in a different lanelet (268) and laterally separated. The longitudinal distance is moderately close and the relative velocities suggest some risk but there is lateral separation
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The lateral separation and TTC suggest no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30785**
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (268) but moderately close longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocities are such that there could be a time risk based on future trajectories, but the current separation provides some buffer.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30786**
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is very close to the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet (2229). This poses a high risk due to proximity.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary, but ego vehicle is moving.  TTC is low. High risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 30788**
- Distance Risk reason: Laterally and longitudinally separated. Different lanelet (1959).
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Stationary obstacle, but enough lateral and longitudinal separation.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30789**
- Distance Risk reason:  Lateral and longitudinal separation. Different lanelet (651).
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocities suggest the vehicles are moving apart.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


**- Obstacle ID: 30790**
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (648) and laterally separated.  Longitudinally relatively close.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The lateral and longitudinal TTC suggest no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30792**
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (648) and laterally separated.  
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The lateral separation provides a safety margin.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
