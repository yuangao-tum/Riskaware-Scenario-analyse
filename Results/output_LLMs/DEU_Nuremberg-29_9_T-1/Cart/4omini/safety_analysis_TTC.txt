Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.6 seconds):
To analyze the scenario for potential collisions, consider the following parameters: the ego vehicle's position, orientation, velocity, and acceleration, along with the positions and characteristics of obstacles nearby.

### Analysis Steps:

1. **Identify Obstacles in the Same Lanelet or Trajectory**: 
   The ego vehicle's lanelet is 992.0. The obstacles in the analysis are located in lanelets 269.0, 268.0, 2229.0, 1959.0, and 651.0, which are different from the ego's lanelet. Therefore, we will not consider them for collision risk evaluation.

2. **Calculated Metrics**:
   - Since none of the obstacles are in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, we assume that there is a negligible risk of collision for all obstacles based on their location.

### Safety analysis for timestep 2.6:
Given the analysis, we will evaluate each obstacle even though they are in different lanelets.

### Obstacle Analysis:

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
``` 

### Summary of Findings:
There are no obstacles with collision risk (Overall Risk Score of 0) or extreme risk (Overall Risk Score of 1) in this scenario. All obstacles presented have negligible risk and are thus classified with an overall score of 5.
