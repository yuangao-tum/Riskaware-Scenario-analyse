Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.6 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**### Obstacle Analysis:**

#### Obstacle ID: 30782.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is at a significant distance from the ego vehicle being positioned at (-352.1447, 253.6731) while the ego is at (-398.8776, 225.2258). Given their separate lanelets, their trajectories are not converging immediately.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 
- **Time Risk reason**: The velocity difference (11.9593 vs 3.5673) suggests that the obstacle is moving away faster and not posing an immediate collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5 
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 

#### Obstacle ID: 30783.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at (-346.2676, 260.5456), it remains significantly distant from the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet, so no immediate trajectory clash.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 
- **Time Risk reason**: Moving faster than the ego vehicle. The lateral and longitudinal paths aren't aligning soon.
- **Time safety score**: 5 
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 

#### Obstacle ID: 30785.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle positioned closer at (-377.6901, 244.3007). However, the risk is still minimal given the same trajectory calculations.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 
- **Time Risk reason**: With greater speed than ego, its passing trajectory doesn't result anticipatively into the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 5 
- **Overall Risk score**: 4.5 

#### Obstacle ID: 30786.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: A stationary obstacle at (-395.9438, 228.5852) but located almost on the ego's trajectory might cause a moderate risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 
- **Time Risk reason**: Stationary, results in caution if delaying a directional or velocity change in ego trajectory.
- **Time safety score**: 3 
- **Overall Risk score**: 3 

#### Obstacle ID: 30788.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (-393.1704, 254.7563) but stationary, isn't immediately risky but important to consider.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 
- **Time Risk reason**: Though stationary and off trajectory, negligible time constraints as long as the path is maintained.
- **Time safety score**: 4 
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 

#### Obstacle ID: 30789.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at a moderately distant location (-383.6743, 259.1379) but moving at a low speed which doesn't converge with the ego's path trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 
- **Time Risk reason**: Owing to both velocity and acceleration minimization, the calculated time frames moderate risks.
- **Time safety score**: 4 
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 

#### Obstacle ID: 30790.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Adequately distanced relative to ego at (-369.117, 265.7943). Its separate trajectory accounts for minimal possible impact.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 
- **Time Risk reason**: Rushing away faster, implies prolonged absence of an intersect in the pathway.
- **Time safety score**: 5 
- **Overall Risk score**: 4.5 

#### Obstacle ID: 30792.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Further apart near (-346.2939, 277.4774), leaving low space intersection possibilities.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 
- **Time Risk reason**: Acceleration drop-off and distance imply a negligible time collision likelihood.
- **Time safety score**: 5 
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```
Overall, no collision or extreme risk scenarios were notable, and all calculated risks remain either low or negligible. The separation in lanes alongside variances in position and velocity results in minimal potential for intersection with the ego vehicle's path at the present juncture.
