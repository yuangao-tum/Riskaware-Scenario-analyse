### Safety analysis for timestep 2.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30782.0
- Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance (47.5 m) and lateral distance (-15.37 m) suggest the obstacle is relatively far away. Even though it is in the front-right, the movement away from the ego car decreases collision risk.
- Distance safety score: **4**
- Time Risk reason: The longitudinal relative velocity (7.44 m/s) indicates the obstacle is moving away, which implies minimal risk. There is still time to react even if the distances are closer.
- Time safety score: **4**
- Overall Risk score: **4**

#### Obstacle ID: 30783.0
- Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance (56.54 m) and lateral distance (-15.36 m) are quite substantial. The obstacle also moves away from the ego vehicle, indicating low likelihood for collision.
- Distance safety score: **4**
- Time Risk reason: Longitudinal relative velocity of (8.99 m/s) reinforces that the risk of collision is low, allowing for time to adjust safety maneuvers.
- Time safety score: **4**
- Overall Risk score: **4**

#### Obstacle ID: 30785.0
- Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance (23.76 m) is closer than previous obstacles but still indicates a generally safe distance. The negative lateral distance (-2.07 m) indicates that this obstacle is somewhat nearby, yet still controllable.
- Distance safety score: **3**
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity longitudinally (7.73 m/s) is somewhat significant, yet the obstacle is moving away, providing some margin for reaction.
- Time safety score: **3**
- Overall Risk score: **3**

#### Obstacle ID: 30786.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is at 0.0 m longitudinally and laterally. This indicates a perfect alignment for collision, necessitating immediate observation of its motion.
- Distance safety score: **1**
- Time Risk reason: With the relative velocity of -3.57 m/s, the potential for collision is immediate given the alignment, indicating an urgent need for action.
- Time safety score: **1**
- Overall Risk score: **1**

#### Obstacle ID: 30788.0
- Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance (21.63 m) and lateral (13.27 m) may appear manageable, but the obstacle is moving toward the ego vehicle, necessitating higher caution.
- Distance safety score: **3**
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocity of -3.57 m/s creates potential for a collision; timely reactions will be needed.
- Time safety score: **3**
- Overall Risk score: **3**

#### Obstacle ID: 30789.0
- Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance (31.14 m) is less concerning but with a muscle toward collision (relative velocity of -5.91 m/s), demands awareness.
- Distance safety score: **3**
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocity (-5.91 m/s) is significant and requires prompt reaction to prevent collision.
- Time safety score: **2**
- Overall Risk Score: **2**

#### Obstacle ID: 30790.0
- Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance (45.66 m) is more secure. However, the presence of relative motion towards the ego vehicle raises awareness.
- Distance safety score: **4**
- Time Risk reason: The high relative velocity (-9.22 m/s) increases the urgency and risk. Immediate monitoring is needed.
- Time safety score: **2**
- Overall Risk Score: **3**

#### Obstacle ID: 30792.0
- Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance (69.38 m) is safe, and while the lateral motion is in the direction of the ego vehicle, the overall distance mitigates some risk.
- Distance safety score: **4**
- Time Risk reason: The significant relative velocity indicates an increased risk profile as this obstacle is coming closer quickly.
- Time safety score: **3**
- Overall Risk Score: **3**
