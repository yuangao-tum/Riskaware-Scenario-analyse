### Safety analysis for timestep 2.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30782.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is front-right and moving away with a longitudinal distance of 47.5 m and a lateral distance of -15.37 m. These distances are relatively safe given the described trajectory and motion.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: With a positive longitudinal relative velocity of 7.44 m/s and lateral velocity of -4.67 m/s, the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle. These velocity components suggest a low risk of collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30783.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is front-right with a longitudinal distance of 56.54 m and lateral -15.36 m. It is also moving away, indicating low proximity risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocities (longitudinal 8.99 m/s, lateral -5.18 m/s) imply the obstacle continues to diverge from the ego's path, further lowering collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30785.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned front-right at 23.76 m longitudinally and -2.07 m laterally. The obstacleâ€™s motion indicates it is moving away, which reduces risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Moderate relative velocities (7.73 m/s longitudinally, -4.48 m/s laterally) show divergence, though slightly closer than the previous obstacles.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30786.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is at a longitudinal and lateral distance of 0 m, indicating a collision or stationary overlap.
- **Distance safety score**: 0
- **Time Risk reason**: Stationary with respect to velocity, though a negative longitudinal speed of -3.57 m/s suggests a backward trend; no motion calculation due to current collision.
- **Time safety score**: 0
- **Overall Risk score**: 0

#### Obstacle ID: 30788.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Front-left at 21.63 m longitudinally and 13.27 m laterally with a movement towards the ego-trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal velocity of -3.57 m/s signals it's driving towards the ego, increasing collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30789.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned front-left at 31.14 m longitudinally and 8.91 m laterally, closing in.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Significant closing velocity (-5.91 m/s) indicates a converging path, though lateral divergence is present.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30790.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located at a longitudinal distance of 45.66 m and lateral distance of 2.19 m front-left direction. Driving towards ego's path.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Closing in quickly with -9.22 m/s longitudinal velocity, balanced slightly by lateral divergence.
- **Time safety score**: 2
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30792.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is at a significant 69.38 m longitudinally and -4.32 m laterally in front-right.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Though very fast, converging with -14.33 m/s longitudinally, the considerable distance gives the ego car ample time.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 4
