### Safety analysis for timestep 2.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID**: 30782.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is at a longitudinal distance of 47.5 m and a lateral distance of -15.37 m, indicating it's further away and moving away.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative motion shows that the obstacle is moving away; thus, the TTC is positive and increasing.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID**: 30783.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance from the ego vehicle is 56.54 m longitudinally and -15.36 m laterally, showing it is moving away.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Similar to the previous obstacle, it is moving away; hence, TTC is positive.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID**: 30785.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Real distance is 23.76 m longitudinally and -2.07 m laterally, indicating a closer position compared to previous obstacles but still moving away.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC is manageable with timely reactions due to the non-threatening relative motion.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID**: 30786.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: At 0.0 m longitudinally and laterally, this obstacle is in direct contact with the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: There is immediate collision since the ego vehicle is in contact with the obstacle.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1

- **Obstacle ID**: 30788.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is 21.63 m and lateral distance 13.27 m; the obstacle is moving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is approaching, suggesting a possible collision in the future thus a reduced TTC.
  - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2

- **Obstacle ID**: 30789.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is 31.14 m and lateral distance is 8.91 m; this obstacle is also moving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Similar to the previous obstacle, this one is also approaching and adds to the collision risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2

- **Obstacle ID**: 30790.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is at 45.66 m and lateral distance at 2.19 m; moving toward the ego longitudinally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is approaching, indicating a decreasing TTC.
  - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2

- **Obstacle ID**: 30792.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is 69.38 m and lateral distance is -4.32 m. It is driving toward the ego vehicle in both longitudinal and lateral directions.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC is critical since this obstacle is approaching in both dimensions.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1
