### Safety analysis for timestep 2.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30782.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located 47.5m longitudinally and -15.37m laterally (front-right) and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Obstacle is moving away, so no TTC calculation is needed.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30783.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located 56.54m longitudinally and -15.36m laterally (front-right) and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving away, so no TTC calculation is needed.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30785.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located 23.76m longitudinally and -2.07m laterally (front-right) and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving away, so no TTC calculation is needed.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30786.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at longitudinal and lateral distance 0.0m (collision).
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal relative velocity indicates a collision.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 30788.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located 21.63m longitudinally and 13.27m laterally (front-left) and moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Negative relative longitudinal velocity (-3.57 m/s) suggests a potential collision. Without acceleration information, TTC is approximately 6.08s. The relative acceleration is positive, meaning the vehicle in front is either accelerating more slowly if the ego vehicle is decelerating, or is indeed decelerating more quickly. If the ego vehicle keeps a constant velocity this represents a danger of collision. If ego-vehicle is slowing down there is a possible medium risk. If the ego-vehicle is decelerating the risk is lower. 
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30789.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located 31.14m longitudinally and 8.91m laterally (front-left) and moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Negative relative longitudinal velocity (-5.91 m/s) suggests a potential collision. Without acceleration information, TTC is approximately 5.27s. Positive relative acceleration would extend the TTC, possibly mitigating risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30790.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located 45.66m longitudinally and 2.19m laterally (front-left) and moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Negative relative longitudinal velocity (-9.22 m/s) suggests a potential collision. Without acceleration information, TTC is approximately 4.95s. Positive relative acceleration would extend the TTC, possibly mitigating risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30792.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located 69.38m longitudinally and -4.32m laterally (front-right) and moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Negative relative longitudinal velocity (-14.33 m/s) suggests a potential collision. Without acceleration information, TTC is approximately 4.84s. Positive relative acceleration would extend the TTC, possibly mitigating risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 4
