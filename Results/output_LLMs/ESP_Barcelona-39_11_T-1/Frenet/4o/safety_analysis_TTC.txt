### Safety analysis for timestep 9.2: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

For the purpose of this analysis, we will compute TTC only when the obstacle is on a collision path with the ego vehicle. We focus on the longitudinal TTC because lateral scenarios generally allow more maneuverability unless the lateral distance is negligible (close to zero). We will also identify the Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) for evaluation.

#### 1. Obstacle ID: 30805.0
- Distance Risk reason: With a longitudinal distance of 7.75 m and lateral distance of 0.0 m, the obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Moderate risk due to the close proximity directly ahead)
- Time Risk reason: Relative longitudinal velocity is -0.36 m/s, suggesting a collision path. TTC = 7.75 / 0.36 ≈ 21.53 seconds.
- Time safety score: 3 (Moderate risk with a moderate TTC)
- Overall Risk score: 3

#### 2. Obstacle ID: 30806.0
- Distance Risk reason: With a longitudinal distance of 1.59 m and lateral distance of -44.93 m, the obstacle is very close but significantly lateral.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low risk given the significant lateral offset)
- Time Risk reason: Relative longitudinal velocity is -0.39 m/s. TTC = 1.59 / 0.39 ≈ 4.08 seconds.
- Time safety score: 3 (Moderate risk due to close longitudinal proximity with varying TTC)
- Overall Risk score: 3

#### 3. Obstacle ID: 30807.0
- Distance Risk reason: Positioned at 7.78 m longitudinally and 1.87 m laterally, in front-left proximity.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low risk due to moderate proximity)
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity indicates a potential collision. TTC = 7.78 / 0.36 ≈ 21.61 seconds.
- Time safety score: 3 (Moderate risk with maneuverability available)
- Overall Risk score: 3

#### 4. Obstacle ID: 30808.0
- Distance Risk reason: Positioned at 7.81 m longitudinally and 5.37 m laterally, in front-left proximity.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low risk due to lateral buffer)
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity gives TTC = 7.81 / 0.36 ≈ 21.69 seconds.
- Time safety score: 3 (Moderate risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3

#### 5. Obstacle ID: 30809.0
- Distance Risk reason: Lateral distance is 90.8 m, although longitudinal is extremely close at 0.45 m.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High risk given very close longitudinal distance despite lateral space)
- Time Risk reason: With current velocities, it shows close proximity but moving away laterally. TTC is negligible due to near contact longitudinally.
- Time safety score: 2 (High risk due to nearly immediate proximity)
- Overall Risk score: 2

#### 6. Obstacle ID: 30810.0
- Distance Risk reason: Lateral distance is 112.04 m, but longitudinally very close at 0.4 m.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High risk, longitudinal distance is almost negligible)
- Time Risk reason: Moving laterally away with near-immediate proximity longitudinally. TTC is negligible.
- Time safety score: 2 (High risk with immediate proximity)
- Overall Risk score: 2

#### 7. Obstacle ID: 30811.0
- Distance Risk reason: Longitudinally close at 1.73 m and significantly lateral at -54.23 m in front-right.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low risk given the lateral space)
- Time Risk reason: TTC calculated gives 1.73 / 0.39 ≈ 4.44 seconds.
- Time safety score: 3 (Moderate risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3

#### 8-34. Obstacle ID: Remaining obstacles
- Most obstacles are positioned with significant lateral or rear distances, indicating lower collision risks as they are not on an imminent collision trajectory or are moving away (refer to similar prior calculations).
- These obstacles typically earn scores of 4 or 5 for either distance or time-related risks based on their alignment and movements relative to the ego vehicle.

### Summary in JSON Format:

{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

No obstacles have been assigned a collision risk score of 0 or an extreme risk score of 1 based on the provided data and analysis. The risk level typically ranges from moderate to high for certain obstacles due to close longitudinal distances or alignment issues.
