### Safety Analysis for Timestep 9.2 Seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30805**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance is 7.75 m which is significantly away, but it is moving toward the ego vehicle. Lateral distance is 0.0 m indicates potential for collision.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Relative velocity longitudinally is -0.36 m/s indicates itâ€™s closing in. The calculated TTC = Distance / Velocity = 7.75 m / 0.36 m/s = 21.5 seconds. This gives a favorable time buffer.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30806**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 1.59 m and lateral -44.93 m indicates a very close proximity on the front-right, leading to immediate concern.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC = Distance / Velocity = 1.59 m / 0.39 m/s = 4.1 seconds, showing fast approach toward collision.
  - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30807**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is acceptable at 7.78 m but the lateral distance is slight. 
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC = 7.78 m / 0.36 m/s = 21.5 seconds, is adequate.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30808**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinally at 7.81 m and laterally at 5.37 m indicates the obstacle is far enough away.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC = 7.81 m / 0.36 m/s = 21.7 seconds indicates good separation time.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30809**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is notably close at 0.45 m but lateral distance indicates lateral movement away from the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The collision is imminent given the rapid approach with TTC = 0.45 m / 0.39 m/s = 1.15 seconds.
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30810**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinally very close at 0.4 m; however, lateral movement is away.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC = 0.4 m / 0.42 m/s = 0.95 seconds, indicating a fast approach.
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30811**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinally at 1.73 m and laterally -54.23 m indicates a dangerous position.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC = 1.73 m / 0.39 m/s = 4.4 seconds reflects significant concern.
  - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30813**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is critical at 0.24 m, with no significant lateral offset.
  - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC = 0.24 m / 0.36 m/s = 0.67 seconds suggests immediate threat.
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30821**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is at 1.43 m and lateral -34.41 m creates immediate concern.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC is calculated as 1.43 m / 0.39 m/s = 3.67 seconds indicating immediacy. 
  - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30832**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinally at 1.25 m and laterally -18.98 m creates risk.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC = 1.25 m / 0.33 m/s = 3.8 seconds; significant risk exists.
  - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)
