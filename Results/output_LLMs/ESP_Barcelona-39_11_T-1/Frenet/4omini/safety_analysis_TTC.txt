### Safety analysis for timestep 9.2 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30805.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance (7.75 m) is manageable but approaching; however, it is directly in front.
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: TTC is calculated as Distance / Relative Velocity = 7.75 m / 0.36 m/s = 21.53 seconds. This provides ample time to react since it is significantly above the critical threshold.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: (4 + 5) / 2 = 4.5 => rounded to 4

2. **Obstacle ID: 30806.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance (1.59 m) indicates a very close approach with a lateral component also present.
   - Distance safety score: 2
   - Time Risk reason: TTC = 1.59 m / 0.39 m/s = 4.08 seconds. The approach is high, requiring immediate attention.
   - Time safety score: 2
   - Overall Risk score: (2 + 2) / 2 = 2

3. **Obstacle ID: 30807.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance (7.78 m) is reasonably safe, positioned in left front.
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: TTC = 7.78 m / 0.36 m/s = 21.61 seconds is substantial, allowing sufficient reaction time.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 4.5 => rounded to 4

4. **Obstacle ID: 30809.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance (0.45 m) indicates an immediate threat, although it is moving laterally away.
   - Distance safety score: 1
   - Time Risk reason: TTC = 0.45 m / 0.39 m/s = 1.15 seconds, requiring urgent action.
   - Time safety score: 1
   - Overall Risk score: (1 + 1) / 2 = 1

5. **Obstacle ID: 30810.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance (0.4 m) is critical; the obstacle is very close.
   - Distance safety score: 1
   - Time Risk reason: TTC = 0.4 m / 0.42 m/s = 0.95 seconds demands rapid response.
   - Time safety score: 1
   - Overall Risk score: (1 + 1) / 2 = 1

6. **Obstacle ID: 30821.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance (1.43 m) suggests a high probability of collision, positioned front-right.
   - Distance safety score: 2
   - Time Risk reason: TTC = 1.43 m / 0.39 m/s = 3.67 seconds indicates a manageable risk but requires attention.
   - Time safety score: 3
   - Overall Risk score: (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5 => rounded to 3

7. **Obstacle ID: 30832.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance (1.25 m) poses a realistic threat as it approaches from the front-right side.
   - Distance safety score: 2
   - Time Risk reason: TTC = 1.25 m / 0.33 m/s = 3.79 seconds, moderately urgent.
   - Time safety score: 3
   - Overall Risk score: (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5 => rounded to 3

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30809.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30810.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

### Conclusion:
The analysis indicates two immediate collision threats (Obstacle ID 30809.0 and 30810.0), prompting precautionary measures to ensure safety. Further close assessments are encouraged for less imminent risks like Obstacle ID 30806.0.
