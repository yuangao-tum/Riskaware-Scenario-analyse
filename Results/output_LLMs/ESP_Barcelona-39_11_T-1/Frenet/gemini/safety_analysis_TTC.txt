### Safety analysis for timestep 9.2s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**General Considerations:**  Several obstacles exhibit concerning behavior, particularly those approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally from the front-right.  The presence of obstacle 30813 directly in front at 0.24m poses an immediate collision risk.

**Calculations:** TTC is calculated as DTC / Vrel if Vrel is negative (approaching). If Vrel is positive (receding), TTC is considered infinite (no collision risk). If Vrel is close to zero and DTC is small, risk is assessed based on acceleration.

- **Obstacle ID:** 30805
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Moderately close longitudinally (7.75m) in front, direct alignment.
- **Distance safety score:** 3
- **Time Risk reason:** Approaching longitudinally (-0.36 m/s), but slight positive acceleration might mitigate risk.
- **Time safety score:** 3
- **Overall Risk score:** 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 30806
- **Distance Risk reason:** Very close longitudinally (1.59m), lateral distance is irrelevant due to the front-right position and converging motion.
- **Distance safety score:** 2
- **Time Risk reason:** Approaching both longitudinally (-0.39 m/s) and laterally (1.78 m/s).  High risk.
- **Time safety score:** 2
- **Overall Risk score:** 2

- **Obstacle ID:** 30807
- **Distance Risk reason:** Moderately close longitudinally (7.78m) in front. Lateral distance small.
- **Distance safety score:** 3
- **Time Risk reason:** Approaching longitudinally (-0.36 m/s).
- **Time safety score:** 3
- **Overall Risk score:** 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 30808
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Moderately close longitudinally (7.81m) in front. Lateral distance small.
- **Distance safety score:** 3
- **Time Risk reason:** Approaching longitudinally (-0.36 m/s).
- **Time safety score:** 3
- **Overall Risk score:** 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 30809
- **Distance Risk reason:** Very close longitudinally (0.45m). Lateral movement away mitigates risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 2
- **Time Risk reason:** Approaching longitudinally (-0.39 m/s), but significant lateral movement away (13.4 m/s).
- **Time safety score:** 2
- **Overall Risk score:** 2

- **Obstacle ID:** 30810
- **Distance Risk reason:** Extremely close longitudinally (0.4m).  Lateral movement away mitigates risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 1
- **Time Risk reason:** Approaching longitudinally (-0.42 m/s), but significant lateral movement away (14.36 m/s).
- **Time safety score:** 2
- **Overall Risk score:** 1

- **Obstacle ID:** 30811
- **Distance Risk reason:** Very close longitudinally (1.73m). Lateral distance irrelevant due to motion.
- **Distance safety score:** 2
- **Time Risk reason:** Approaching both longitudinally (-0.39 m/s) and laterally (1.76 m/s).
- **Time safety score:** 2
- **Overall Risk score:** 2

- **Obstacle ID:** 30812
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Moving away longitudinally.  No risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** Moving away longitudinally. No risk.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID:** 30813
- **Distance Risk reason:** Extremely close longitudinally (0.24m) in front, direct alignment. Imminent collision.
- **Distance safety score:** 0
- **Time Risk reason:** Approaching longitudinally (-0.36 m/s).
- **Time safety score:** 0
- **Overall Risk score:** 0

- **Obstacle ID:** 30814
- **Distance Risk reason:** Moderately close longitudinally (7.86m) in front.  Lateral distance moderate.
- **Distance safety score:** 3
- **Time Risk reason:**  Approaching longitudinally (-0.36 m/s).
- **Time safety score:** 3
- **Overall Risk score:** 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 30815
- **Distance Risk reason:** Close longitudinally (0.58m). Moving away both longitudinally and laterally reduces risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** Moving away longitudinally (0.51 m/s) and laterally (0.49 m/s).
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 4


...(Analysis continues similarly for all remaining obstacles.  Note that obstacles moving away longitudinally pose no TTC risk).
