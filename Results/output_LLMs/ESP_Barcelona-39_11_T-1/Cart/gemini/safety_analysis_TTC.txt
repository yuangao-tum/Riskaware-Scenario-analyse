Safety analysis for the last timestep (9.2 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 9.2s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

It's important to note that with the provided data (positions, orientations, velocities, and accelerations), precise TTC and MDC calculations are challenging without further information about vehicle dimensions, shapes, and future trajectory predictions.  The following analysis provides an *approximation* based on point-mass assumptions and current states.  A more robust analysis would require more sophisticated trajectory prediction and collision checking algorithms.

**Assumptions and Simplifications:**

* **Point Mass:** Vehicles are treated as point masses, neglecting their physical dimensions.
* **Constant Acceleration:**  We assume constant acceleration for the short term to estimate TTC, which might not hold true in reality.
* **Lateral Movement Simplification:** Lateral TTC and MDC are estimated based on current positions and velocities, assuming straight-line movement, which is a simplification.

**Methodology:**

1. **Distance Calculation:** Euclidean distance between ego and obstacles.
2. **Longitudinal TTC (TTClong):** Estimated using relative longitudinal velocities and accelerations. If the relative velocity is zero or moving away, TTClong is considered infinite (represented as a large value like 9999).
3. **Lateral TTC (TTClat):** Estimated based on lateral distance and relative lateral velocities, assuming straight-line motion.  If the relative lateral velocity is zero or moving away, TTClat is considered infinite.
4. **Risk Assessment:**  Risk scores are assigned based on estimated TTC and distance, considering both longitudinal and lateral factors.  Low TTC and MDC values lead to higher risk scores.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30805**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in the same lanelet and close to the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Stationary and close, posing a potential collision risk if the ego vehicle doesn't brake in time.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 30813**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, and relatively close.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Moving slowly and close to the ego vehicle, presenting a risk.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30815**
- Distance Risk reason: In a neighboring lanelet but close and moving towards the ego vehicle's lane.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Moving towards the ego vehicle's lane, posing a potential collision risk.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 30827**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively close to the ego vehicle and moving across its path.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Moving across the ego vehicle's path, creating a collision risk.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)



- **Obstacle ID: 30806, 30811, 30821, 30830, 30832:**  These obstacles are in a different lanelet (936 or a related one), traveling in the opposite direction. While not an immediate threat, they should be monitored, especially 30821 and 30832. Risk scores would range from 3 (Medium) to 4 (Low) depending on their lateral distances.

- **Obstacle ID: 30807, 30808, 30814:** These obstacles are stationary in neighboring lanelets and don't pose an immediate threat based on the provided snapshot. Risk score: 4 (Low).

- **Obstacle ID: 30809, 30810:**  These are far away and moving in a different direction.  Risk Score: 5 (Negligible).

- **Obstacle ID: 30812, 30816, 30817, 30818, 30820, 30822, 30823, 30824, 30825, 30826, 30828, 30829, 30831, 30833:** These are either stationary and far enough away, or moving in a way that doesn't pose an immediate threat based on the current snapshot. Risk scores would generally be 3 (Medium) to 5 (Negligible) depending on their distance and relative motion.
