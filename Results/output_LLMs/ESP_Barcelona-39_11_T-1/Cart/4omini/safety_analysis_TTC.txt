Safety analysis for the last timestep (9.2 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 9.2 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

1. **Obstacle ID: 30805.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is located at (308.3159, -26.5035), which is significantly to the right of the ego vehicle's position (299.7017, -17.7851).
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is stationary, allowing for sufficient time for the ego vehicle to adjust position or speed.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30806.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is further away (270.9338, -54.8672) and moving at a velocity, making it less of a concern for collision.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** While it is moving, its trajectory does not intersect with the ego vehicle’s trajectory, giving plenty of time to react.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30807.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned at (310.8259, -24.0636), this obstacle is slightly ahead of the ego vehicle and is stationary.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Given it is stationary, the ego vehicle has ample time to maneuver away if necessary.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 30808.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** At (313.3306, -21.6183), this obstacle is also stationary and positioned further ahead of the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Again, with no movement towards the ego vehicle and being stationary, there is complete freedom to maneuver.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 30815.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle, located at (306.5238, -18.1924), is moving but presents a low risk since it’s still on the ego vehicle’s left.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** The ego vehicle retains a safe time to maneuver since the obstacle is moving slowly relative to absolute speed.
   - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID: 30812.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned at (294.5163, 2.1166), this obstacle is stationary, well out of the immediate path.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** The stationary condition means it's safely out of the way with no immediate concerns.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

7. **Obstacle ID: 30828.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle, located at (281.9689, -0.1476), is out of the trajectory and also stationary.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** It poses no immediate risk since it is stationary and at a safe distance.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

Overall, most of the obstacles present low to negligible risk, making the scenario relatively safe at this time slice.
