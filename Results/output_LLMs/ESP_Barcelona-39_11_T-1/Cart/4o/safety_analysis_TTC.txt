Safety analysis for the last timestep (9.2 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 9.2 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30805.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Close proximity in the same lanelet with zero velocity, indicating minimal lateral movement.  
   - **Distance safety score**: 2
   - **Time Risk reason**: Given the obstacle is static (velocity=0), the TTC concerns are high.
   - **Time safety score**: 1
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1

2. **Obstacle ID: 30806.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Already at a different lanelet at considerable distance from the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: No immediate collision risk due to divergence in lanelet and movement direction.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 30807.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Different lanelet and no velocity; positioned slightly ahead.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3
   - **Time Risk reason**: Obstacle is static; TTC not applicable here.
   - **Time safety score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

4. **Obstacle ID: 30808.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned ahead in a neighboring lanelet.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Static position; no temporal risk due to lack of velocity.
   - **Time safety score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

5. **Obstacle ID: 30809.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Different trajectory and high speed quantify negligible risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Moving away from the ego car path, indicating a negligible time concern.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

6. **Obstacle ID: 30810.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Same justification as 30809.0 with similar trajectory and speed.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: No risk of collision owing to trajectory and speed.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

7. **Obstacle ID: 30811.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Some distance with different lanelet and low velocity suggest minimal risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: On a different trajectory, no TTC risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

8. **Obstacle ID: 30812.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Within relative distance but no motion, indicating manageable risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3
   - **Time Risk reason**: No velocity eliminates immediate TTC consideration.
   - **Time safety score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

9. **Obstacle ID: 30813.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Same lanelet but very low velocity implies low risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2
   - **Time Risk reason**: Nearly static, TTC indicates urgency.
   - **Time safety score**: 1
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1

10. **Obstacle ID: 30814.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Different lanelet and non-moving, medium distance risk.
    - **Distance safety score**: 4
    - **Time Risk reason**: Static obstacle in different lane indicates no immediate time concern.
    - **Time safety score**: 4
    - **Overall Risk score**: 4

11. **Obstacle ID: 30815.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Ahead in same lanelet, minor velocity change could impact ego vehicle.
    - **Distance safety score**: 2
    - **Time Risk reason**: More immediate concern due to velocity change.
    - **Time safety score**: 2
    - **Overall Risk score**: 2

### Summary in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30805.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
```

The analysis reveals that Obstacle 30805.0 and 30813.0 represent significant risk factors being static and positioned directly in the path of the ego vehicle.
