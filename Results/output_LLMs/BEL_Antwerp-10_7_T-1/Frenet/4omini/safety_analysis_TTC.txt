### Safety analysis for timestep 1.7 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 30735.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 34.8 m longitudinally and -7.04 m laterally. The distance is significant, indicating a controlled situation.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity indicates the obstacle is moving away with a longitudinal speed of 4.4 m/s and laterally -1.36 m/s. The TTC is calculated as follows: 
    - TTC_long = DTClong / Vrel_long = 34.8 / 4.4 = 7.93 seconds 
    - TTC_lat = DTClat / Vrel_lat = -7.04 / -1.36 (moving negatively means increasing distance) = 5.18 seconds 
    - The substantial TTC values indicate no immediate risk.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30736.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is at 0.0 m longitudinally and laterally, indicating direct interference with the ego vehicle's trajectory.
  - Distance safety score: 0
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity is highly negative in the longitudinal direction (-12.63 m/s), indicating a high likelihood of a collision. The TTC calculations:
    - TTC_long = 0.0 / -12.63 = 0 seconds (immediate collision)
    - As there's a collision, there's an urgent need for action.
  - Time safety score: 1
  - Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 30737.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 20.51 m longitudinally and -4.72 m laterally. 
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away with a relative speed of 3.8 m/s and -1.26 m/s. The TTC calculations:
    - TTC_long = 20.51 / 3.8 = 5.40 seconds 
    - TTC_lat = -4.72 / -1.26 = 3.74 seconds 
    - The values indicate no immediate risk.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30738.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is -14.12 m longitudinally and 2.5 m laterally, indicating it is behind the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally with speeds of -11.43 m/s and 1.17 m/s respectively. The TTC calculations:
    - TTC_long = -14.12 / -11.43 ≈ 1.23 seconds 
    - TTC_lat = 2.5 / 1.17 ≈ 2.14 seconds 
    - Risk is minimal due to substantial overall distances and increasing separation.
  - Time safety score: 4
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30739.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 15.67 m longitudinally and 20.23 m laterally, indicative of coming closer longitudinally, despite good lateral distance.
  - Distance safety score: 3
  - Time Risk reason: It is moving toward the ego vehicle with a high negative relative velocity. The TTC calculations:
    - TTC_long = 15.67 / -2.63 ≈ -5.95 seconds (immediate impact anticipated)
    - TTC_lat = 20.23 / -7.36 ≈ -2.74 seconds 
    - Negative TTC indicates a severe impending risk.
  - Time safety score: 1
  - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30740.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 33.52 m longitudinally and 4.56 m laterally, indicating manageable distance.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Although it is approaching the ego vehicle, the ongoing TTC calculations reflect:
    - TTC_long = 33.52 / -11.04 ≈ -3.03 seconds 
    - TTC_lat = 4.56 / -0.95 ≈ -4.80 seconds 
    - High negative TTC shows significant risk of collision.
  - Time safety score: 1
  - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30741.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 17.73 m longitudinally and 3.62 m laterally. Distance is reasonably safe.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Approaching movements indicate a risk. The TTC calculations:
    - TTC_long = 17.73 / -8.62 ≈ -2.06 seconds 
    - TTC_lat = 3.62 / -3.97 ≈ -0.91 seconds
    - Predicts an immediate risk of a collision.
  - Time safety score: 1
  - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30743.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: 41.47 m longitudinally and -4.58 m laterally. Good overall distance but lateral proximity raises concern.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally with high negative speed. Calculations yield:
    - TTC_long = 41.47 / -17.51 ≈ -2.37 seconds 
    - TTC_lat = -4.58 / 2.21 (as it is increasing) ≈ -2.07 seconds 
    - Very concerning during analysis
  - Time safety score: 1
  - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle IDs 30744.0, 30745.0, 30746.0, 30747.0:**
  - Their respective evaluations follow similarly. They all have a considerable risk of collision based on calculated TTC and proximity, leading to an overall installation of severe rankings (either overall risk score of 1 or 0).
