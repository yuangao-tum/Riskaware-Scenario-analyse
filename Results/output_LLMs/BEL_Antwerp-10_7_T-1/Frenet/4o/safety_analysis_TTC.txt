### Safety analysis for timestep 1.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30735.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Positioned 34.8 m longitudinally and -7.04 m laterally from ego; moving away in both directions.
   - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal and lateral velocities indicate the obstacle is moving away; relatively safe.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30736.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Identified at collision distance (0.0 m longitudinal and lateral).
   - Distance safety score: 0 (Collision)
   - Time Risk reason: No time to collision as it is already in contact.
   - Time safety score: 0 (Collision)
   - Overall Risk score: 0 (Collision)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30737.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Positioned 20.51 m longitudinally and -4.72 m laterally from ego; moving away laterally and longitudinally.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Moderate risk due to sufficient distance and moving away trend.
   - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 30738.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Positioned -14.12 m longitudinally (rear-left), moving away laterally and longitudinally.
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Significant relative speed; however, direction indicates moving away.
   - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 3.5 (Medium-Low Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 30739.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Positioned 15.67 m longitudinally and 20.23 m laterally; heading towards ego vehicle.
   - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Closing in on the ego vehicle longitudinally and laterally, necessitating attention.
   - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID: 30740.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Positioned 33.52 m longitudinally and 4.56 m laterally from ego; driving toward the vehicle.
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Relative velocity indicates decreasing separation; manageable risk with timely intervention.
   - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

7. **Obstacle ID: 30741.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Positioned 17.73 m longitudinally and 3.62 m laterally; both directions converging toward ego.
   - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Obstacle is closing distance quickly; requires immediate attention.
   - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

8. **Obstacle ID: 30743.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Positioned 41.47 m longitudinally and -4.58 m laterally; converging toward ego.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Despite considerable convergence speed, sufficient time before risk increases.
   - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 3.5 (Medium-Low Risk)

9. **Obstacle ID: 30744.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Positioned 14.48 m longitudinally and 58.92 m laterally; directional convergence.
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Quick lateral convergence but sufficient longitudinal buffer; attention required.
   - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

10. **Obstacle ID: 30745.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Positioned 46.72 m longitudinally and 6.58 m laterally; driving towards ego longitudinally.
    - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: The longitudinal approach is fast but exists manageable with appropriate response.
    - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

11. **Obstacle ID: 30746.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Positioned 24.73 m longitudinally and 107.8 m laterally far; approaching longitudinally.
    - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally but not immediately threatening due to large lateral distance.
    - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

12. **Obstacle ID: 30747.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Positioned 63.33 m longitudinally and 9.35 m laterally; approaching longitudinally.
    - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: Adequate distance allows for controlled handling despite approaching movement.
    - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
