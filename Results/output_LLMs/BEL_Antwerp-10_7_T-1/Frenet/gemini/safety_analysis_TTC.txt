- Distance Risk reason:  33.52m longitudinally and 4.56m laterally (front-left) but approaching.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Closing, requires more data for accurate TTC, but potentially medium risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30741.0**
- Distance Risk reason: 17.73m longitudinally and 3.62m laterally (front-left) and approaching.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Closing, more data needed for TTC, potentially medium to high risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 30743.0**

- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


**- Obstacle ID: 30746.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  24.73m longitudinally and 107.8m laterally (front-left). Lateral distance is substantial, but longitudinal approach needs attention.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally, more data needed for TTC. Moderate risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


**- Obstacle ID: 30747.0**
- Distance Risk reason: 63.33m longitudinally and 9.35m laterally (front-left), but approaching.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Closing, more data needed for accurate TTC, but likely medium risk due to the distance.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 4
