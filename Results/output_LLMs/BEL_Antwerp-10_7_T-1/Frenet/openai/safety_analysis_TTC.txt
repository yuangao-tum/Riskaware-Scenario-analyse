### Safety analysis for timestep <1.7 seconds>: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 30735.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance is 34.8 m (safe), and the lateral distance is -7.04 m (indicating the obstacle is to the right, but moving away).
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal relative velocity is 4.4 m/s and lateral is -1.36 m/s. The obstacle is moving away, indicating no threat of collision.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30736.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The ego vehicle is at the exact position of this obstacle (0.0 m, 0.0 m).
  - Distance safety score: 0
  - Time Risk reason: The velocities indicate a high likelihood of collisions; therefore, immediate action is required.
  - Time safety score: 1
  - Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 30737.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance is 20.51 m and the lateral distance is -4.72 m (indicating a safe distance as the obstacle is moving away).
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: As the obstacle is moving away longitudinally at a speed of 3.8 m/s, there is no risk of collision.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30738.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance of -14.12 m indicates it's behind the ego vehicle, which is not relevant for collision.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocities indicate the obstacle is moving away, presenting no collision risk.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30739.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance of 15.67 m and lateral of 20.23 m mean the obstacle is far in both dimensions but moving toward the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: The longitudinal relative velocity is -2.63 m/s, indicating a risk of getting closer, necessitating attention.
  - Time safety score: 3
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30740.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance of 33.52 m and lateral distance indicates a safe distance, but still approaching the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: The longitudinal relative velocity is -11.04 m/s, showing a significant risk of closure, indicating medium risk.
  - Time safety score: 3
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30741.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance of 17.73 m and lateral distance indicate a reasonably safe distance, albeit approaching.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: The longitudinal velocity of -8.62 m/s suggests a strong risk of closure.
  - Time safety score: 2
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30743.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance of 41.47 m and lateral distance of -4.58 m suggest it is approaching from the right side yet is not in an imminent collision path.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: With a longitudinal velocity of -17.51 m/s, there is a significant risk of closure.
  - Time safety score: 2
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30744.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance of 14.48 m and lateral distance of 58.92 m indicate this obstacle is significantly far laterally but is approaching.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal velocity of -5.48 m/s shows potential risk of closure.
  - Time safety score: 3
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30745.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance of 46.72 m and lateral distance of 6.58 m indicate safety but approaching laterally from the left.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Closing at -10.3 m/s longitudinally suggests a potential risk.
  - Time safety score: 3
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30746.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance of 24.73 m and lateral distance of 107.8 m signal a distant obstacle but with closure in motion laterally.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Closing at -5.34 m/s gives an indication of risk.
  - Time safety score: 3
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30747.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance of 63.33 m and lateral distance of 9.35 m indicate it is safe, though approaching.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity of -11.57 m/s indicates a significant potential closure.
  - Time safety score: 2
  - Overall Risk score: 3
