Safety analysis for the last timestep (1.7 seconds):
I'll analyze the safety metrics for this scenario:

### Key Observations:
1. The ego vehicle is in lanelet 58/59, decelerating from 10.5 m/s to 3.9 m/s
2. Most relevant obstacles to monitor:
   - Obstacle 30738: In same lanelet 59
   - Obstacle 30736: Moving into lanelet 59

### Safety Analysis:

For Obstacle 30738:
- Distance Risk Reason: Starting at ~5.8m lateral distance, maintaining consistent separation
- Distance Safety Score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk Reason: Relative velocities are manageable, no immediate collision risk
- Time Safety Score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)

For Obstacle 30736:
- Distance Risk Reason: Moving closer to ego vehicle's lanelet but maintaining safe distance
- Distance Safety Score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk Reason: Converging paths but velocities allow for control
- Time Safety Score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk)

For Other Obstacles:
All other obstacles are either in different lanelets or maintaining safe distances with no immediate collision risks.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

### Overall Assessment:
1. The scenario shows no immediate collision risks
2. The ego vehicle is decelerating appropriately
3. The closest interaction is with Obstacle 30738, but maintaining safe distance
4. The movement patterns are predictable and controlled
5. No emergency maneuvers appear necessary

Recommendations:
1. Continue monitoring Obstacle 30738
2. Maintain current deceleration profile
3. Be prepared for potential lane change from Obstacle 30736

The situation appears to be under control with no extreme risks or imminent collisions identified.
