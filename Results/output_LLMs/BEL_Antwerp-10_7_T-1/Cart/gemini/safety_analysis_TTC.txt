Safety analysis for the last timestep (1.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 1.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

*  Since precise trajectories are not provided, we assume straight-line motion for TTC calculations.  This is a simplification and a more robust analysis would involve predicted trajectories.
* I will use a simplified TTC and MDC calculation for demonstration. In a real-world scenario, more complex calculations considering vehicle shapes, orientations, and future trajectories would be necessary.
*  "Relative direction" implies whether the obstacle is approaching (higher risk) or receding (lower risk).
* Thresholds for risk scores based on TTC and MDC would be defined based on vehicle dynamics and safety requirements, which are not provided here.  I'll use illustrative thresholds.

**Illustrative Thresholds (Example):**

* **TTC:** TTC < 1s: Extreme Risk, 1s <= TTC < 3s: High Risk, 3s <= TTC < 5s: Medium Risk, TTC >= 5s: Low/Negligible Risk.
* **MDC:**  MDC < 2m: Extreme Risk, 2m <= MDC < 5m: High Risk, 5m <= MDC < 10m: Medium Risk, MDC >= 10m: Low/Negligible Risk


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30735**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet (55) than the ego vehicle (59), laterally separated.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Lateral separation reduces risk, but longitudinal motion needs further assessment with proper trajectories. Assuming straight-line motion for now.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30736**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in the same lanelet (59) and close in proximity, posing a high risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Close proximity and likely approaching, implying a high risk.  Requires immediate attention.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2
