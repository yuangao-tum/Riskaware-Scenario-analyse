Safety analysis for the last timestep (1.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 1.7 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacles Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30735.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is located at position (-285.555, 49.5719) which is significantly further in the negative x-direction compared to the ego vehicle’s position (-267.4902, 85.542). The minimum distance is calculated based on this position.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: With an ego velocity of 3.9332 and the obstacle's velocity of 8.4469, the relative speeds indicate that the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle, resulting in a TTC that suggests no imminent collision.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (average of distance and time scores)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30736.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is also in the same lanelet (lanelet 59.0), located slightly ahead of the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3
   - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC indicates a noticeable risk due to relative velocities.
   - **Time safety score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

3. **Obstacle ID: 30737.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is located at (-279.7831, 62.8482) in lanelet 55.0 which is close to lanelet 59.0 but still not directly in the trajectory of the ego vehicle's lanelet.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC evaluations show that the obstacle is inaccurately positioned based on speeds.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

4. **Obstacle ID: 30738.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned further in lanelet 59.0 but at a sufficient distance to maintain safety.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Similar to previous scoring metrics, no imminent collision is forecast.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

5. **Obstacle ID: 30739.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located far away at (-251.2951, 60.6034) in a different lanelet, leading to minimal risk assessment.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity indicates that it is moving slower than the ego vehicle.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

6. **Obstacle ID: 30740.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In lanelet 336.0 and moving towards a further lane than ego; distance is manageable.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Again, the obstacle is far enough and velocities suggest no collision.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

7. **Obstacle ID: 30741.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is almost directly in the way but appropriately distanced.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3
   - **Time Risk reason**: Collision threat analysis gives a medium score since decision-making can positively change outcomes here.
   - **Time safety score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

8. **Obstacle ID: 30743.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 56.0, significantly far from ego vehicle’s pathway, distance is manageable.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: With a velocity of 13.7551, it doesn’t pose a threat to the ego vehicle.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

9. **Obstacle ID: 30744.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is located far away and is also in lanelet 379.0, safe separation.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: This obstacle has a relative speed that is not a threat.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

10. **Obstacle ID: 30745.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Another obstacle on lanelet 336.0 located at (-272.1738, 33.8761) poses minimal risks.
    - **Distance safety score**: 4
    - **Time Risk reason**: No imminent collision forecasted based on velocities.
    - **Time safety score**: 5
    - **Overall Risk score**: 4

11. **Obstacle ID: 30746.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Located within lanelet 379.0 and at a sizable distance.
    - **Distance safety score**: 4
    - **Time Risk reason**: Again poses no collision threat with lower relative velocity.
    - **Time safety score**: 5
    - **Overall Risk score**: 4

12. **Obstacle ID: 30747.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Distant and on lanelet 336.0, clearly a non-threat due to distance.
    - **Distance safety score**: 5
    - **Time Risk reason**: The circumstances allow sufficient reaction time before any potential risk.
    - **Time safety score**: 5
    - **Overall Risk score**: 5
