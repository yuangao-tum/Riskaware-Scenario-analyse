Safety analysis for the last timestep (1.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 1.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30735.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is in lanelet 55.0, different from the ego vehicle. Despite the lower proximity, a direct collision route is not immediate due to differing lanelets.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Higher velocity but lane separation offers buffer time; negligible instant TTC.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30736.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (59.0) with a close longitudinal and lateral proximity, indicating a moderate chance of impact.
  - Distance safety score: 3
  - Time Risk reason: Moderate TTC given the similar trajectory and speed.
  - Time safety score: 3
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30737.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet (55.0) with some proximity; moderate likelihood of collision as the speeds are comparable.
  - Distance safety score: 3
  - Time Risk reason: TTC improved by different lane positioning but direction and velocity require monitoring.
  - Time safety score: 3
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30738.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Occupies the same lanelet (59.0); relatively safer distance due to opposing velocity vector.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Favorable TTC since the speed difference might prevent immediate crossing paths.
  - Time safety score: 4
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30739.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Located in a far lanelet (379.0) with substantial spatial separation.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Adequate time before potential risk due to the significant quality of distance.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30740.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Different lanelet (336.0) and further lane separation dilute immediate collision risk.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Adequate TTC levels ensured by considerable existing gap.
  - Time safety score: 4
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30741.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Despite the reasonably close proximity, diverging lanelets (430.0) to ego means lower impact chances.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Different directional velocity vector supports longer TTC.
  - Time safety score: 4
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30743.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Lanelets (56.0) do not intersect; additional buffer provides safety.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: High-speed difference entails significant TTC prior predictions.
  - Time safety score: 4
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30744.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Positioned in lanelet 379.0, too remote to become an immediate hurdle.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Ample TTC due to anticipated absence of route interference.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30745.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Lanelet 336.0 and distinct paths with ego vehicle imply low MDC concerns.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Limited proximation ensures reasonably high TTC.
  - Time safety score: 4
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30746.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Even with speed, considerably offset in lanelet (379.0), maintaining negligible MDC effects.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Significant spatial lead translates into optimal TTC.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30747.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Situated within lanelet 336.0, comparatively isolated longitudinally and laterally.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Extended TTC given disparate navigation paths.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5
