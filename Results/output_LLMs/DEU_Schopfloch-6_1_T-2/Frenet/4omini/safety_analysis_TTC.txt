### Safety analysis for timestep 4.9: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID**: 20020.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 11.39 m and lateral distance is -2.01 m, indicating proximity to the ego vehicle with a significant lateral offset.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity longitudinally is -3.35 m/s, suggesting a possible approach rate. Calculating TTC gives approximately 3.4 seconds (TTC = distance / velocity = 11.39 m / 3.35 m/s). This indicates a manageable approach time.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

2. **Obstacle ID**: 20023.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Similar to 20020.0, it is 11.24 m away longitudinally and -9.34 m laterally, indicating a significant distance but reasonable proximity.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC is approximately 3.35 seconds, indicating a manageable approach.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

3. **Obstacle ID**: 20025.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal 10.86 m and lateral -16.33 m suggests minimal distance but still reasonable space.

   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC is approximately 3.24 seconds, indicating a manageable situation.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

4. **Obstacle ID**: 20027.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal 10.64 m and lateral -23.3 m show that the obstacle is relatively far.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC is approximately 3.17 seconds, indicating a controllable situation.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

5. **Obstacle ID**: 20032.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal 10.72 m and lateral -30.28 m suggests a safe distance.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC of approximately 3.2 seconds shows manageability.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

6. **Obstacle ID**: 20042.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal 11.26 m and lateral -37.23 m indicate safe space.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC is about 3.36 seconds, indicating a manageable risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

7. **Obstacle ID**: 20054.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at 12.21 m longitudinally and -60.72 m laterally, this is a safe distance.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's relative velocity suggests a bit more management is needed, but TTC is about 20.10 seconds, manageable.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

8. **Obstacle ID**: 20056.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of 12.2 m and lateral -44.14 m indicate a safely disposed area.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC shows similar metrics as above, around 3.63 seconds, manageable.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

9. **Obstacle ID**: 20057.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Collisional distance (0.0 m) poses an extreme threat.
   - **Distance safety score**: 0 (Collision)
   - **Time Risk reason**: There is an imminent collision due to exact alignment.
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 0

10. **Obstacle ID**: 20078.0
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal 20.56 m and lateral -78.01 m shows a reasonable distance.
    - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
    - **Time Risk reason**: TTC is approximately 6.12 seconds, so this is manageable.
    - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20057.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    }
}
``` 

### Conclusion:
- **Collision risk exists only for Obstacle ID 20057.0**, which poses an immediate threat; hence, the overall risk score is 0.
- **No obstacles present extreme risk**, which would have been marked with a risk score of 1.
