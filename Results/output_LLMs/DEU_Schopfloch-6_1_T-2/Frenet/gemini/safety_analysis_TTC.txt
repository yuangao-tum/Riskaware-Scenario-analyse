### Safety analysis for timestep 4.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

* **TTC Calculation:**  TTC = -Relative Distance / Relative Velocity.  A negative relative velocity indicates the objects are moving towards each other. If the relative velocity is positive (moving away), TTC is considered infinite (no collision risk). If relative velocity is zero, there will be no collision if the objects are not at the same spot; otherwise, there will be a collision.
* **MDC Calculation:** Not explicitly calculable from the given data. We can infer relative risk based on current distances and velocities. We'll use distance and velocity trends to assess MDC risk qualitatively.
* **Combined Risk:** The overall risk score is determined by considering both distance and TTC, leaning towards the higher risk level if there's a significant discrepancy.
