Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.9 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.9: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 20057**
   - Distance Risk reason: The ego vehicle is in the same lanelet (292.0) as this obstacle. The lateral distance is small given the obstacle’s velocity (6.9262) is approaching the ego vehicle.
   - Distance safety score: 2
   - Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is considerably high, indicating an imminent risk of collision due to the small distance.
   - Time safety score: 2
   - Overall Risk score: 2

2. **Obstacle ID: 20054**
   - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is moving at a rapid speed (11.2226) and is situated at a considerable distance along the longitudinal axis. The ego vehicle is far from this obstacle.
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: While it’s moving quickly, the distance is sufficient to prevent an immediate threat due to considerable distance coverage by the ego vehicle's current speed (3.3527).
   - Time safety score: 4
   - Overall Risk score: 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 20042**
   - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is far from the ego vehicle. It is stationary and sits in lanelet 206.0, which indicates a manageable spatial relationship.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: Being stationary, the obstacle presents a negligible time risk since the ego vehicle can maneuver as needed without approaching it.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

4. **Obstacle ID: 20040**
   - Distance Risk reason: As a stationary obstacle in a different lanelet than the ego vehicle, it presents no immediate lateral threat.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: The time to collision is negligible due to the stationary nature of the object; it is far enough not to provoke concern.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

5. **Obstacle ID: 20032**
   - Distance Risk reason: As a stationary obstacle in lanelet 206.0, it is safely distanced from the ego vehicle.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: It does not present any risk of collision since it is completely stationary, allowing complete maneuverability.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

6. **Obstacle ID: 20070**
   - Distance Risk reason: Moving at a moderate velocity but located in a different lanelet, thereby not posing any immediate threat to the ego vehicle.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: There is no risk for time to collision given the adequate separation and the bold nature of motion away from the ego vehicle.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

#### Summary in JSON Format:

}
```

### Evaluation Conclusion:
Based on the analysis:
- **Obstacles with Collision Risk**: None present at this timestep.
- **Extreme Risk Obstacles**: None found.

The overall risk assessment indicates that the ego vehicle may encounter a manageable risk with low probability of collision with identified obstacles. The situation remains controllable, primarily due to maintaining a safe distance from more hazardous obstacles whilst demonstrating genuine potential collision concerns with Obstacle ID: 20057. Further monitoring is advisable concerning continue velocity considerations.
