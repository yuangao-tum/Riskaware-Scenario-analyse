Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.9 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories, dimensions of vehicles, and lanelet geometries are not provided, this analysis makes simplifying assumptions.  We'll primarily use Euclidean distance as a proxy for both longitudinal and lateral distance, acknowledging that this is a simplification.  TTC will be approximated based on current velocities and closing speeds, again assuming straight-line motion. A more rigorous analysis would require detailed trajectory predictions and consideration of vehicle shapes.  We also consider the general direction of the obstacle relative to the ego vehicle.

**### Obstacle Analysis:**

- **Obstacle ID: 20020**
    - Distance Risk reason: Far from ego vehicle.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: No apparent closing velocity or collision course.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20023, 20025, 20027, 20032, 20042, 20056, 20058, 20063, 20069, 20075, 20078, 20081, 20082**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located significantly ahead of the ego vehicle, likely in a different lane.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Stationary or slow-moving and not on a collision course.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20048, 20049, 20059**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located far behind and traveling in the opposite direction.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason:  Moving away from ego vehicle.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20054, 20067, 20071, 20076**
    - Distance Risk reason: Far ahead of the ego vehicle, moving in the same general direction but possibly in another lane.  Requires more information to assess lane relationship.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Moving faster than or at a similar speed to ego, so catching up might be slow or not occurring.  Further lane information needed.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20057**
    - Distance Risk reason: Close in proximity, located ahead in the same lane.
    - Distance safety score: 3
    - Time Risk reason: Moving faster than the ego vehicle; further assessment needed based on closing speed and deceleration capabilities.
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 20060, 20072, 20077, 20080**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Relatively close proximity but not directly ahead; likely in different lanes or on intersecting trajectories. Requires more information about lane geometry and intended path.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Stationary or slow-moving, but more information on trajectories is needed to assess potential crossing conflicts.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20061, 20065, 20066, 20068, 20073, 20079, 20083**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located behind the ego vehicle, some relatively close, possibly in adjacent lanes or merging lanes.  More information required about lane assignments and intentions.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Some are moving slower than ego; others are close to ego's speed.  Merging/lane change behavior needs clarification.
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 20070, 20084**
    - Distance Risk reason: Far from the ego vehicle, likely on a different road section.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Moving, but far enough away that there's no immediate risk.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5


- **Obstacle ID: 20074**
    - Distance Risk reason: Not directly ahead of ego and likely in a different lane. More context needed for accurate assessment.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Slow-moving; no apparent immediate risk, but further context needed.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4
