Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.9 seconds):
I'll analyze the safety metrics for the ego vehicle's trajectory and nearby obstacles.

### Safety Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 20057 (In lanelet 292, same as ego)**
- Distance Risk reason: Starting at position (-4.3347, -11.1146) and moving towards ego's path, lateral distance is concerning (~2-3m)
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Converging paths with similar velocities (ego: ~4.8m/s, obstacle: ~6.9m/s)
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 20072 (In lanelet 291, adjacent to ego)**
- Distance Risk reason: Close lateral proximity to ego vehicle (~1.5m)
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Low relative velocity and decreasing speed (from 3.6m/s to 0.092m/s)
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 20060 (In lanelet 650, near ego)**
- Distance Risk reason: Stationary obstacle close to ego's path
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: No immediate collision risk due to static position
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Key Observations:
1. While there are several obstacles in proximity to the ego vehicle, none present an immediate collision risk (score 0) or extreme risk (score 1).
2. The most concerning obstacle is 20057, which is moving in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle with a higher velocity.
3. The ego vehicle maintains reasonable safety distances and shows appropriate deceleration behavior when needed (velocity decreasing from 4.8m/s to 3.3m/s).
4. Lateral separation from adjacent obstacles remains sufficient throughout the trajectory.

The situation shows moderate risk levels but no immediate collision dangers, suggesting appropriate safety measures are in place.
