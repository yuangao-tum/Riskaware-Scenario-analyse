Safety analysis for timestep 4.1 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- Obstacle ID: 30655
  - Relative Direction: Front
  - Distance Risk Reason: Extremely close longitudinal distance to collision at 0.05 meters, indicating a very high risk due to near immediate collision.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1 (as wdominant = 1 for front)
  - Time Risk Reason: Extremely short longitudinal time to collision at 0.01 seconds, indicating immediate risk of collision.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 1 (as wdominant = 1 for front)
  - Overall Risk Score: 1 (0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 1)

- Obstacle ID: 30656
  - Relative Direction: Front
  - Distance Risk Reason: Negligible longitudinal distance risk due to 9.82 meters space, indicating safe distance.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5 (as wdominant = 1 for front)
  - Time Risk Reason: High longitudinal time risk at 0.84 seconds, indicating probable collision path in near future.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 2
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 2 (as wdominant = 1 for front)
  - Overall Risk Score: 4 (0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 2)

- Obstacle ID: 30658
  - Relative Direction: Behind
  - Distance Risk Reason: Negligible longitudinal distance risk at 17.64 meters, allowing ample space for safety.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5 (as wdominant = 1 for back)
  - Time Risk Reason: Negligible time risk at 9.62 seconds, which indicates a safe time margin.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 5 (as wdominant = 1 for back)
  - Overall Risk Score: 5 (0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 5)

- Obstacle ID: 30659
  - Relative Direction: Rear-right
  - Distance Risk Reason: No risk from longitudinal distance at 27.74 meters; lateral distance at 8.08 meters also shows no risk.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5 (as wdominant = 0.5 for rear-right)
  - Time Risk Reason: Infinite longitudinal time indicates no collision risk; moderate lateral time risk at 1.29 seconds, suggesting watchfulness.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 3
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 4 (as wdominant = 0.5 for rear-right)
  - Overall Risk Score: 5 (0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 4)
