### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30655
- **Relative Direction:** Front
- **Distance Risk Reason:** The longitudinal distance to collision is very close at 0.05, indicating an immediate threat, while the lateral distance is 0.0, leading to an extreme risk situation.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 1  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 0
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 1.0
- **Time Risk Reason:** The longitudinal time to collision is extremely short at 0.01, suggesting an imminent collision, with the lateral time being 0.0, reinforcing the extreme risk.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 1
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 0
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 1.0
- **Overall Risk Score:** 1

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30656
- **Relative Direction:** Front
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Longitudinal distance to collision is 9.82, which indicates minimal risk, while the lateral distance is 0.0, suggesting a minor position risk but not immediate.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 0
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 2.5
- **Time Risk Reason:** The longitudinal time to collision at 0.84 indicates some time before potential impact; hence, it's at moderate risk. Lateral time is 0.0, suggesting an apparent side alignment risk.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 2
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 0
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 1.0
- **Overall Risk Score:** 1.25 (rounded down to 1)

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30658
- **Relative Direction:** Behind
- **Distance Risk Reason:** The longitudinal distance to collision is 17.64, and lateral distance is 0.0, indicating no risk of collision as the obstacle is significantly far behind.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 0
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 2.5
- **Time Risk Reason:** The longitudinal time to collision of 9.62 indicates no imminent threat, and lateral time of 0.0 denotes a potential risk if positioned laterally.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 5
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 0
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 2.5
- **Overall Risk Score:** 2.5 (rounded down to 2)

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30659
- **Relative Direction:** Rear-right
- **Distance Risk Reason:** The longitudinal distance to collision is 27.74, which is far, and the lateral distance is 8.08, indicating no immediate collision risk.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 4
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 4.5
- **Time Risk Reason:** The longitudinal time to collision is infinity, indicating no chance of collision, and the lateral time of 1.29 shows that the obstacle is moving laterally away and poses no threat.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 5
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 3
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 4.0
- **Overall Risk Score:** 4.25 (rounded down to 4)
