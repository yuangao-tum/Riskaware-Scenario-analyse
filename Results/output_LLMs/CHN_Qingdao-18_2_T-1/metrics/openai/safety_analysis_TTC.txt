Safety analysis for timestep 4.1 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30655
- **Relative Direction:** Front
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Longitudinal distance is extremely close (0.05), leading to a very high likelihood of collision. Lateral distance is exactly zero, indicating direct alignment with the ego vehicle.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 1  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 0
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 1.0 (DSC)
- **Time Risk Reason:** Longitudinal time to collision is critically low (0.01), indicating imminent collision risk. Lateral time is zero, confirming immediate danger.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 1
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 0
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 1.0 (TSC)
- **Overall Risk Score:** 1 (rounded from 1.0)

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30656
- **Relative Direction:** Front
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Longitudinal distance (9.82) is safe, well above critical levels, and lateral distance is also zero but doesn't present a direct collision threat due to sufficient longitudinal distance.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 0
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 4.0 (DSC)
- **Time Risk Reason:** Longitudinal time (0.84) indicates a potential risk if not monitored. Lateral time is zero indicating possible direct alignment but doesn't create immediate danger due to the longitudinal distance.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 2
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 0
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 1.0 (TSC)
- **Overall Risk Score:** 2.5 (rounded from 2.5)

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30658
- **Relative Direction:** Behind
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Longitudinal distance (17.64) and lateral distance (0.0) suggest minimal risk from behind as the ego car moves forward.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 0
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 4.0 (DSC)
- **Time Risk Reason:** Longitudinal time (9.62) is safe, indicating sufficient time to react against potential collisions. Lateral time (0.0) is not impactful given the relative position.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 5
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 0
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 4.0 (TSC)
- **Overall Risk Score:** 4.0 (rounded from 4.0)

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30659
- **Relative Direction:** Rear-right
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Longitudinal distance (27.74) is ample, suggesting no immediate threat. Lateral distance (8.08) is also safe, as the obstacle is moving away.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 4
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 4.5 (DSC)
- **Time Risk Reason:** Longitudinal time is infinity, indicating zero collision risk. Lateral time (1.29) is safely above critical risk levels, confirming minimal threat.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 5
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 3
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 4.0 (TSC)
- **Overall Risk Score:** 4.25 (rounded from 4.25)
