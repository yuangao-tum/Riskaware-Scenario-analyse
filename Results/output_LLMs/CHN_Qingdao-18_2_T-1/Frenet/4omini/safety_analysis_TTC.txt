### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID**: 30655.0
  - Distance Risk reason: The real distance to this obstacle is 0.05 m longitudinally and 0.0 m laterally. With a very small longitudinal distance, it is extremely close to the ego vehicle, indicating a significant risk of immediate collision.
  - Distance safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Calculating TTC:
    - Longitudinal TTC = Distance/Relative Velocity = 0.05 m / 3.75 m/s = 0.0133 seconds
    - Lateral TTC = Distance/Relative Velocity = 0.0 m / 0.0 m/s = N/A (irrelevant for longitudinal impact)
    - The very low longitudinal TTC shows an urgent need for immediate action to mitigate a collision.
  - Time safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **1** (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30656.0
  - Distance Risk reason: The real distance to this obstacle is 9.82 m longitudinally and 0.0 m laterally. This distance suggests that while the obstacle is relatively far compared to the previous one, it’s still in the path of the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Calculating TTC:
    - Longitudinal TTC = 9.82 m / 11.74 m/s ≈ 0.836 seconds
    - Lateral TTC is not applicable since it is also relatively aligned laterally.
    - The longitudinal TTC suggests a moderate time frame to respond, but proximity indicates the vehicle must be monitored closely.
  - Time safety score: **3** (Medium Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **3** (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30658.0
  - Distance Risk reason: The distance is -17.64 m longitudinally, indicating that this obstacle is behind the ego vehicle. Lateral distance remains irrelevant in this context for collision opportunity.
  - Distance safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Calculating TTC:
    - Longitudinal TTC = -17.64 m / 1.83 m/s = -9.628 seconds (indicating it's behind and moving away)
    - The negative TTC indicates that it is not a risk factor for collision and does not need to be monitored for frontal collision.
  - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **5** (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30659.0
  - Distance Risk reason: The distance is -27.74 m longitudinally, indicating that this obstacle is also behind the ego vehicle; however, it has a lateral component of -8.08 m.
  - Distance safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Calculating TTC:
    - Longitudinal TTC = -27.74 m / -2.43 m/s = 11.421 seconds (indicating it's moving away)
    - Lateral TTC is again irrelevant due to position.
    - This further confirms there is no risk of collision.
  - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **5** (Negligible Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30655.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30655.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
```
### Additional Notes:
- Obstacle 30655.0 indicates an immediate threat and requires urgent action to prevent collision.
- Obstacle 30656.0 poses a moderate risk but is manageable with timely reactions.
- Obstacles 30658.0 and 30659.0 are at negligible risk levels as they are positioned behind and moving away from the ego vehicle.
