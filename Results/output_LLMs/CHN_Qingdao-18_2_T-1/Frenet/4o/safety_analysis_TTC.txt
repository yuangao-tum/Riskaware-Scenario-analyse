### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 30655.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is extremely close and directly in front of the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of only 0.05 m. This represents an immediate collision situation.
  - Distance safety score: 1
  - Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal velocity is -3.75 m/s, indicating the obstacle is closing in rapidly. Since the distance is so minimal, the time to collision is virtually zero, indicating an extreme risk.
  - Time safety score: 1
  - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30656.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 9.82 m. Although reasonable, it is approaching rapidly.
  - Distance safety score: 3
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity of -11.74 m/s in the longitudinal direction indicates a quick approach, resulting in a moderate time to collision, indicating a medium risk.
  - Time safety score: 3
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30658.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -17.64 m. It has a low risk of directly impacting the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity indicates it is moving toward the ego vehicle but not at a rate to cause immediate concern, resulting in a negligible risk to time.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30659.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is at a rear-right position, approximately -27.74 m longitudinally and -8.08 m laterally. It is moving away longitudinally, which reduces collision risk significantly.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: The motion away from the ego vehicle indicates a lateral increase in distance, resulting in negligible risk.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5
