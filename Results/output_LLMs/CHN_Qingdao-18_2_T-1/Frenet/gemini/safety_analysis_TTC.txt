### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30655.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is almost touching the ego vehicle longitudinally (0.05m) and has zero lateral distance, indicating a very high risk of collision.  The obstacle is in front and moving towards the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score:** 0
- **Time Risk reason:**  The relative longitudinal velocity is -3.75 m/s (towards the ego vehicle) and the distance is minimal. This results in a very small TTC, indicating imminent collision.
- **Time safety score:** 0
- **Overall Risk score:** 0

- **Obstacle ID:** 30656.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** While 9.82m longitudinally might seem safe, the high closing velocity (-11.74 m/s) suggests a rapidly decreasing distance. Lateral velocity (+5.47m/s) could indicate a potential crossing/cutting-in action that could elevate risk as the longitudinal distance decreases.
- **Distance safety score:** 2
- **Time Risk reason:** The relatively high closing velocity combined with the longitudinal distance results in a short TTC, representing a very high risk of collision if the current trajectories are maintained.
- **Time safety score:** 1
- **Overall Risk score:** 1

- **Obstacle ID:** 30658.0
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Obstacle is 17.64m behind the ego vehicle, which is a safe distance longitudinally. The exact lateral alignment suggests zero lateral distance, so needs monitoring.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:**  The obstacle is approaching from behind (1.83 m/s), but the distance and relatively small velocity suggest no immediate risk.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4


- **Obstacle ID:** 30659.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is relatively far behind (-27.74m) and to the side (-8.08m) of the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is moving away longitudinally (-2.43 m/s) and the lateral motion (6.26 m/s towards the car) poses no immediate threat due to the large initial separation.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5
