### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID**: 30655.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 0.05 m, which is extremely close to the ego car. The lateral distance is 0.0 m, indicating that the obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 0 (Extreme Risk: immediate collision)
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity longitudinally is -3.75 m/s; using this, the TTC = DTClong / |Vrel_long| = 0.05 / 3.75 ≈ 0.0133 seconds. This indicates immediate collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 0 (Extreme Risk: immediate collision)
- **Overall Risk score**: 0 (Collision)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30656.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 9.82 m, which provides more space than the previous obstacle, but the lateral distance is 0.0 m, indicating this obstacle is also directly in front.
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk: close to collision)
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity longitudinally is -11.74 m/s; therefore, TTC = 9.82 / 11.74 ≈ 0.837 seconds, which indicates that a collision is probable but not immediate.
- **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30658.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance of -17.64 m indicates that this obstacle is behind the ego car, posing little immediate threat, with the lateral distance of 0.0 m indicating direct alignment.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity longitudinally is 1.83 m/s means this obstacle is moving away backward. As it's behind and moving away, the TTC is positive and long enough (irrelevant for collision assessment).
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30659.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is -27.74 m and lateral distance is -8.08 m, indicating that this obstacle is further away and slightly to the rear-right of the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity longitudinally is -2.43 m/s; hence, TTC = -27.74 / -2.43 ≈ 11.42 seconds. This indicates that there’s no immediate risk to collision due to the significant time until any potential interaction.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)
