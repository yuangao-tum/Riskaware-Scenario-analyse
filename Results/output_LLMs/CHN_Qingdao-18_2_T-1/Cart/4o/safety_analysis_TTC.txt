### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1 seconds:

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30655.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is in the same lanelet and relatively close to the ego vehicle (small lateral distance). Minimal speed indicates low risk of quickly changing positions.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3
   - **Time Risk reason**: With both the ego and the obstacle velocity considered, TTC longitudinal is increased since the obstacle is stationary. However, due to same lanelet position, the lateral TTC might be low.
   - **Time safety score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

2. **Obstacle ID: 30656.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is in a different lanelet and is positioned further away laterally from the ego vehicle, decreasing the risk of immediate collision.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Due to its position in another lanelet, and its movement away from the vehicle's trajectory, there should be a significant TTC, reducing risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 30658.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is in the same lanelet but ahead of the ego vehicle. While within the ego's path, the distance is significant enough to mitigate immediate collision risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3
   - **Time Risk reason**: Moving moderately faster than the ego vehicle, which implies increasing clearance over time. The longitudinal and lateral TTC should not reflect imminent danger.
   - **Time safety score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

4. **Obstacle ID: 30659.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located ahead but at a reasonable distance, given both vehicles' velocities, collision likelihood is minimized.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Its forward movement and velocity reduce the likelihood of collision, allowing more time to react.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4
