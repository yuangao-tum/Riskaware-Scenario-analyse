Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.1 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30655.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The ego vehicle position is at (602.7093, -2180.5002) and the obstacle is at (599.8082, -2184.3219). The current distance is approximately 3.9443 meters. In lateral terms, they are relatively close vertically (within about 3.8217 m).
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: The ego vehicle has a velocity of 3.7485 m/s, while the obstacle is stationary (velocity = 0). The time to collision (TTC) is calculated as follows: at 3.9443 m distance and closing at the difference of velocities (3.7485 m/s), TTC is approximately 1.0537 seconds.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk) 

- **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30656.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The ego vehicle at (602.7093, -2180.5002) is approximately 5.6184 meters from the obstacle at (597.0909, -2193.7266). The distance in longitudinal terms can be assessed as less alarming since it's also the only vertical distance.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is traveling towards (a speed of 9.6832 m/s) the ego vehicle's path. The TTC is negative (-0.5796 seconds), indicating the vehicle is moving towards the potential collision path rapidly.
- **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30658.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The distance from the ego vehicle (602.7093, -2180.5002) to this obstacle (609.7489, -2159.4954) is about 8.7523 meters, which is considerably away from the ego vehicle's trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is approaching at a speed of 5.8392 m/s. With the current distance of 8.7523 m, the TTC is approximately 1.4982 seconds (sufficient time to react).
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk) 

- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30659.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The ego vehicle's position relative to this obstacle (603.9499, -2146.8523) is about 33.6477 meters longitudinally. Hence, the distance risk is minimal.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: This obstacle is moving at 6.4016 m/s. Given its distance of 33.6477 meters from the ego vehicle, the TTC would be approximately 5.2609 seconds, allowing for enough reaction time.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk) 

- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format: 
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30656.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

### Conclusions:
The primary concern indicated in this analysis is with obstacle ID 30656.0, which presents an extreme risk, while the other obstacles, while generally low to medium risk, suggest the need for vigilant monitoring and potential avoidance strategies for the ego vehicle.
