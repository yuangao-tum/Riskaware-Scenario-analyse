Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.1 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30655**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30655 is located very close to the ego vehicle in the same lanelet (465) and almost stationary (0 m/s), posing an immediate threat of rear-ending.  The small lateral distance suggests minimal room for maneuver.
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The ego vehicle is approaching the obstacle at 3.75 m/s while the obstacle is stationary, indicating a very short time to collision.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30656**
- Distance Risk reason: Although Obstacle 30656 is in a different lanelet (1191), its proximity to the ego vehicle and its high velocity (9.68 m/s) might pose a risk depending on the intersection geometry and the future trajectories of both vehicles. More information is needed to accurately assess the risk.  The lateral distance needs consideration.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Without precise trajectory information, the TTC is hard to determine. If the paths intersect, the high speeds involved mean a collision could occur rapidly.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 30658**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 30658 is in the same lanelet (465) as the ego vehicle, but it is located further ahead and moving in the same general direction. The longitudinal and lateral distances appear sufficient at this moment.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Both vehicles are moving in the same direction, and the obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego's.  This indicates a decreasing risk of collision if current trends continue. The ego vehicle is decelerating more than the obstacle vehicle which could increase risk.  More information about future trajectories would refine this assessment.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 30659**
- Distance Risk reason: Similar to 30658, this obstacle is in the same lanelet (465), ahead of the ego vehicle, and moving in the same direction.  The distances suggest even less risk than with obstacle 30658.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  The relative speeds and directions, along with the current separation, point towards no immediate collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
