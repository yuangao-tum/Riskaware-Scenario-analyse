Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.1 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario and evaluate collision risks.

### Safety Analysis:

1. Obstacle ID: 30655.0 (In same lanelet 465)
- Distance Risk reason: Starts at position (606.65, -2170.94) and remains stationary after initial movement. Maintains safe lateral separation.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Vehicle comes to a complete stop, reducing collision risk over time.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

2. Obstacle ID: 30658.0 (In same lanelet 465)
- Distance Risk reason: Starts relatively close to ego vehicle at (584.24, -2132.66), moving in same direction with decreasing velocity.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Maintains reasonable separation and similar direction of travel.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

3. Obstacle ID: 30659.0 (In same lanelet 465)
- Distance Risk reason: Initially at (579.26, -2126.74), maintains safe distance throughout.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving in similar direction with controlled deceleration.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

4. Obstacle ID: 30656.0 (In lanelet 460/1191)
- Distance Risk reason: Operating in different lanelet with sufficient lateral separation.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No direct conflict path with ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Key Observations:
- Ego vehicle decelerates from 17.54 m/s to 3.75 m/s
- All obstacles maintain controlled movements
- No imminent collision risks detected
- Closest interaction is with Obstacle 30658.0, but maintains safe separation

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

The analysis shows no collision obstacles (score 0) or extreme risk obstacles (score 1). The lowest risk score is 3, indicating manageable risk levels throughout the scenario.
