### Safety analysis for timestep 3.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30368.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: With a longitudinal distance of 27.51 m and a lateral distance of 1.94 m, the obstacle is relatively close, particularly laterally, indicating it is nearing the lane of the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The longitudinal relative velocity of -8.29 m/s suggests that the obstacle is closing in rapidly. However, due to its slightly larger distance, immediate action is not required.
  - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30369.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Although the obstacle is positioned at a lateral distance of 5.84 m, its longitudinal distance is 61.88 m, which provides the ego vehicle with ample space.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away laterally and with a slower closure rate longitudinally (-3.38 m/s), allowing for manageable response times.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30370.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Lateral distance of 123.64 m indicates this obstacle is far to the side and doesn't pose an immediate threat despite being at 8.45 m longitudinally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Very slow closure rate means there is plenty of time (relative velocity of -0.99 m/s longitudinally means a slow approach).
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30371.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Both longitudinal and lateral distances (38.59 m and -36.06 m respectively) suggest separation, yet the negative lateral distance indicates a relative positioning towards one side.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Moderate closing rate (-5.98 m/s) indicates time to react yet crossing motion needs observation.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30372.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned directly in front at 50.76 m, which is a safe distance.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative speed of 14.47 m/s moving away guarantees no immediate risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30373.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Lateral distance of 78.58 m suggests it is far to the side despite being relatively close at 8.51 m longitudinally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Slow longitudinal approach rate (-0.99 m/s) implies adequate time to react.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30374.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is at an extremely near longitudinal distance of 0.2 m which represents an imminent collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 0 (Collision Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: With a relative velocity of -1.0 m/s, this is immediately critical with minimal time for reaction.
  - **Time safety score**: 0 (Collision Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 0 (Collision Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30376.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: At 49.47 m longitudinally and quite far laterally, the obstacle remains at a considerable distance.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Slowing approach with a closure rate of -2.75 m/s provides ample reaction time.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30377.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: With a longitudinal distance of 8.56 m, proximity suggests closer monitoring is required.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Slow closure (-0.99 m/s) allows for manageable interventions.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30378.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: With a reasonable distance of 8.59 m in front and lateral distance (11.84 m), it doesn't pose a severe immediate threat.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Slow approach (-1.0 m/s), providing time to respond.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30379.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: At 57.79 m longitudinally and -69.19 m laterally, the obstacle is distant.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Moderate closure rate (-6.29 m/s), which allows for corrective measures without rush.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30380.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Similar to obstacles analyzed, it poses minimal threat with 98.36 m lateral distance.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Slow longitudinal approach rate of -0.99 m/s provides time for decision-making.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30381.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: With a longitudinal distance of 97.06 m and laterally not aligning directly with the path, its threat is negligible.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The motion remains slow at -1.0 m/s, ensuring sufficient reaction time.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
