To evaluate the provided scenario, I will calculate the Time to Collision (TTC) for both longitudinal and lateral components for each obstacle, determine their distances from the ego car, and assign risk scores according to the definitions provided.

### Definitions:
- **TTC (Time to Collision)**: TTC is calculated by dividing the distance by the relative velocity in that direction. If the relative velocity is negative, it indicates a potential collision.

- **MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision)**: This will be the smallest distance measured in both longitudinal and lateral from the ego vehicle to the obstacles. It's crucial for determining the immediate risk.

### Calculations:
1. **TTC Calculation**:
   - For longitudinal (TTC_long): 
     \[ \text{TTC}_{\text{long}} = \frac{\text{DTClong}}{-\text{Vrel_long}} \]
   - For lateral (TTC_lat): 
     \[ \text{TTC}_{\text{lat}} = \frac{\text{DTClat}}{-\text{Vrel_lat}} \]

2. **MDC Calculation**: 
   The smallest between DTClong and DTClat will be considered for MDC.

3. **Risk Assessment**: 
   Based on TTC and MDC, risk scores will be assigned accordingly.

### Safety analysis for timestep 3.7 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 30368.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinally close (27.51 m) and laterally very close (1.94 m) to the ego car.
  - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Longitudinal TTC = 27.51 / 8.29 = 3.32 s; Lateral TTC is 1.94 / 0.01 = 194 s (Non-threatening laterally)
  - Time Risk reason: High potential for longitudinal collision despite high lateral distance.
  - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30369.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Further away longitudinally (61.88 m) but moving laterally (5.84 m).
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Longitudinal TTC = 61.88 / 3.38 = 18.3 s; Lateral TTC = 5.84 / -5.63 (moving away) = -1.04 s (Not a risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinally at significant distance, Lateral is safe.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30370.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Very close longitudinally (8.45 m) and at a significant lateral distance (123.64 m).
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Longitudinal TTC = 8.45 / 0.99 = 8.55 s; Lateral TTC = 12.72 / -14.31 (moving toward) = -0.89 s.
  - Time Risk reason: Significant longitudinal collision risk.
  - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30374.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Very close at 0.2 m.
  - Distance safety score: 0 (Collision)
  - Longitudinal TTC = 0.2 / 1.0 = 0.2 s, Lateral TTC = N/A (Not applicable, direct collision).
  - Time Risk reason: Immediate collision.
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 0 (Collision)

- **Obstacle ID: 30372.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Somewhere between, 50.76 m longitudinal and safe laterally (0.0 m).
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Longitudinal TTC = 50.76 / -14.47 (moving away) = -3.5 s; Lateral is not applicable.
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinally safe as moving away.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30374.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30368.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
```

### Findings:
- **Collision Risk**: Obstacle 30374.0 was found to present an immediate collision risk with an Overall Risk Score of 0.
- **Extreme Risk**: Obstacle 30368.0 posed an extreme risk indicated by an Overall Risk Score of 1.
- All other obstacles assessed as low or high risk showed more time to collision or further distance, thereby reducing their overall risk.
