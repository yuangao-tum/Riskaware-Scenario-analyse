### Safety analysis for timestep 3.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30368.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively close longitudinally (27.51m) and laterally (1.94m) in the front-left.  
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally (-8.29 m/s) and slightly laterally (-0.01 m/s).  TTC needs to be calculated to assess properly, but initial assessment is moderate risk.

- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally (-5.98 m/s) and moving away laterally (7.14 m/s). Moderate risk due to longitudinal closing.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30372.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Safe distance longitudinally (50.76m) and laterally aligned to ego in front.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally (14.47 m/s). Negligible risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30373.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Far laterally (78.58m) though close longitudinally (8.51m) in front-left. Lateral distance mitigates longitudinal proximity.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Slightly closing longitudinally (-0.99 m/s) and moving away laterally (-12.72 m/s). Low risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30374.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close longitudinally (0.2m) and laterally aligned (0.0m) in front. **Imminent collision.**
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally (-1.0 m/s). **Imminent collision.**
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 30376.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively safe distance longitudinally (49.47m) and laterally (-52.79m) in front-right.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally (-2.75 m/s) but moving away laterally (8.16 m/s). Low risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


**- Obstacle ID: 30377.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Close longitudinally (8.56m) though moderately far laterally (35.18m) in front-left. Longitudinal proximity poses some risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Slightly closing longitudinally (-0.99 m/s) and moving away laterally (-8.37 m/s). Low risk due to the larger lateral speed.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30378.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Close longitudinally (8.59m) and laterally (11.84m) in front-left, presenting moderate risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally (-1.0 m/s) and laterally (-2.17 m/s), increasing the risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 30379.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Safe distance longitudinally (57.79m) and laterally (-69.19m) in front-right.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally (-6.29 m/s) and moving away laterally (7.6 m/s). Low risk due to lateral movement and safe longitudinal distance.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30380.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Far laterally (98.36m) though close longitudinally (8.48m) in front-left. Lateral distance mitigates longitudinal proximity.

- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30381.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Far longitudinally (97.06m) and safe lateral distance (22.53m) in front-left.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Slightly closing longitudinally (-1.0 m/s) and moving away laterally (-11.37 m/s). Low risk due to distances and lateral movement.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
