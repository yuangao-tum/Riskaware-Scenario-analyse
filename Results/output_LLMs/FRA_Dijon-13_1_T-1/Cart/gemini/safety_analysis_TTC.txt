Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**Methodology:**

Since precise TTC and MDC calculations require future trajectory predictions which are not provided, we will perform a qualitative assessment based on the given position, velocity, and acceleration information.  We'll consider relative velocity and direction as primary indicators of risk.  "Longitudinal" and "Lateral" TTC/MDC are approximated based on these factors.

- **Obstacle ID: 30368**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located in a different lanelet, laterally separated.  Longitudinal distance moderate but moving faster than ego.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The velocity difference suggests this obstacle might approach the ego vehicle from behind, but not imminently.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30369**
- Distance Risk reason: In a different lanelet and laterally separated.  
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No immediate time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30370**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet and far away. Moving faster than ego vehicle, but not on a collision course.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30371**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet and reasonably separated.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Moving faster than ego but not in a concerning direction.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30372**
- Distance Risk reason:  In a different lanelet but relatively close. High velocity. This obstacle requires closer attention.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: High velocity and proximity create a medium-term risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30373**
- Distance Risk reason: In a different lanelet. Moderate distance and moving relatively fast.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Poses some risk due to velocity.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30374**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in the same lanelet as ego and very close.  Stationary, so no immediate collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Stationary object presents a low time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3


- **Obstacle ID: 30376**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet, lateral separation.
- Distance safety score: 5

- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30378**
- Distance Risk reason: In a different lanelet, relatively close.  Low velocity.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Low velocity reduces immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30379**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30380**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet, moving quickly but not towards ego.
