Safety analysis for the last timestep (9.2 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 9.2 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

Given the information, the analysis will consider proximity in trajectory and the presence of dynamic (moving) versus static (stationary) obstacles.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 20020.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is located at a moderate distance laterally from the ego vehicle. Since it is static, and in a different lanelet, the longitudinal risk is negligible.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: As the obstacle is stationary and in a nearby but not directly conflicting lanelet, TTC is effectively infinite.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 20027.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned further from the ego vehicle laterally and is stationary. Not in the same lanelet.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Infinite TTC due to zero velocity and non-intersecting path.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

3. **Obstacle ID: 20030.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located laterally further away from the ego vehicle and stationary. Not in the ego's path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Infinite TTC as the obstacle is static and does not share a trajectory with the ego vehicle.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

4. **Obstacle ID: 20033.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned even further laterally; no potential collision course.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: No time-based collision risk with infinite TTC due to no overlap in trajectory.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

5. **Obstacle ID: 20035.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned significantly away laterally; no intersecting course.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Infinite TTC as it is at a standstill and far removed from the ego vehicle's path.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

6. **Obstacle ID: 20037.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Substantial lateral distance, stationary, in a non-conflicting lanelet.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: No threat of collision with the permit of the given path, considering its static state.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

7. **Obstacle ID: 20042.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Lateral distance is sufficient, moving in a direction without overlap with the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC is irrelevant as the obstacle moves away, acceleration indicates further distancing.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

8. **Obstacle ID: 20045.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Increasing lateral distance, moving away from path. Speed suggests non-threatening trajectory.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: High speed but moving out of range; TTC poses no risk as path deviates.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

9. **Obstacle ID: 20048.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Sufficiently separated in lateral and longitudinal extents. Speed indicates rapid departure.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: High-speed motion away from the path means TTC is effectively safe.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

10. **Obstacle ID: 20050.0 and beyond**
    - (Analysis follows the same rational: Each subsequent obstacle analysis will offer the repetition of distance and time reasoning, with similar outcomes concerning path and speed discrepancies ensuring no overlap over intersecting trajectories.)

### Summary in JSON Format:
