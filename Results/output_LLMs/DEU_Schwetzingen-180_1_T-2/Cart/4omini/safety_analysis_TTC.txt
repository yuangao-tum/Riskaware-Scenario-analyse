Safety analysis for the last timestep (9.2 seconds):
To analyze the potential collision risks in the provided scenario, we will follow the steps outlined in the task. We will identify obstacles in the same trajectory as the ego vehicle, calculate Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC), and evaluate the risks accordingly.

### Steps:

**1. Identify obstacles in the same lanelet or trajectory as the ego vehicle:**
The ego vehicle is located in lanelet 9888.0. From the provided data, the corresponding obstacles are mainly located in lanelets like 1679.0, 1680.0, and 1636.0. However, we will focus on those which share the same or adjacent lanelets.

**2. Calculate the metrics:**
- **TTC**: This will be estimated based on the velocities and distances of the obstacles relative to the ego vehicle.
- **MDC**: The smallest distance to the obstacles will determine proximity.

**3. Provide detailed reasoning for all conclusions:**

### Safety analysis for timestep 9.2: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 20020.0**
  - Distance Risk Reason: Obstacle is significantly left of the ego vehicle (-6.32, -0.39) at -5.57 units away.
  - Distance Safety Score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk Reason: Obstacle is stationary, making the TTC extremely high.
  - Time Safety Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk Score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20042.0**
  - Distance Risk Reason: Closer than Obstacle 20020.0; however, it is also moving slowly away.
  - Distance Safety Score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk Reason: TTC calculations yield a moderate time due to its proximity but slow lateral speed.
  - Time Safety Score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk Score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 20045.0**
  - Distance Risk Reason: Further from ego vehicle but with a higher speedâ€”proximity is concerning.
  - Distance Safety Score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk Reason: Significant TTC due to ongoing relative speed.
  - Time Safety Score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Overall Risk Score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 20048.0**
  - Distance Risk Reason: Increasing distances as the ego vehicle is located further left.
  - Distance Safety Score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk Reason: Speed is high compared to the ego vehicle causing moderate TTC.
  - Time Safety Score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Overall Risk Score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 20094.0**
  - Distance Risk Reason: Very close to the ego vehicle, which is problematic given its movement.
  - Distance Safety Score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Time Risk Reason: With the obstacle moving at 2.14, this yields a potential rapid impact.
  - Time Safety Score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Overall Risk Score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 20095.0**
  - Distance Risk Reason: Partially obscured values necessitate caution.
  - Distance Safety Score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk Reason: Infinite potential collision due to being stationary.
  - Time Safety Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk Score: 4

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, there are no immediate collision risks (Overall Risk Score of 0), and there are no obstacles considered as extreme risk (Overall Risk Score of 1) in this scenario. The evaluated risks primarily indicate low to medium risks with some needing moderate attention regarding their relative velocities and distances.
