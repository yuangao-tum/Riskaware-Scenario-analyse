Safety analysis for the last timestep (9.2 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 9.2s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories, dimensions of vehicles, and lanelet shapes are not provided, I am making some simplified assumptions for this analysis:

* **Point Objects:** Treating vehicles as point objects for distance calculations.
* **Constant Velocity/Acceleration (Short Term):**  Assuming constant velocity and acceleration for the very near future to estimate TTC.  This is a limitation, especially with changing accelerations.
* **Lanelet Interpretation:**  Lanelet IDs alone don't provide enough information about their spatial relationship (e.g., parallel lanes, intersecting lanes). I'm assuming lanelets with different IDs indicate a degree of separation, though this may not always be true.
* **Lateral TTC/MDC Approximation:** Lacking precise lane information, lateral assessment is approximate.  A more detailed analysis would require lane boundaries and vehicle widths.

**Calculations (Illustrative):**

I'll illustrate the basic TTC calculation, recognizing that a robust solution would use more complex methods handling non-linear motion.

TTC_longitudinal = (Relative Longitudinal Distance) / (Relative Longitudinal Velocity)
TTC_lateral = (Relative Lateral Distance) / (Relative Lateral Velocity)

If relative velocity is zero or towards each other, TTC will be positive and indicate potential collision risk, which depends on the value of TTC, from collision risk to negligible risk. If relative velocity is away from each other, there is no risk of collision, thus TTC is infinite and the risk level is negligible, and safety score is 5.

Similarly, MDC could be estimated using equations of motion or minimum distance between projected trajectories.  A low value is higher risk, while a larger value reduces the risk, which depends on the specific MDC value.


### Obstacle Analysis:

* **Obstacle ID: 20020.0**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Relatively close laterally and longitudinally, in a different but potentially adjacent lanelet.
    - Distance safety score: 3
    - Time Risk reason: Stationary obstacle, ego vehicle approaching.  TTC depends on the ego vehicle's deceleration and precise lane geometry.
