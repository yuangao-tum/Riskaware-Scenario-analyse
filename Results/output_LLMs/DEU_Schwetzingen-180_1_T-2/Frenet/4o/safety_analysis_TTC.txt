### Safety analysis for timestep 9.2: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 20020.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: DTClong of 0.15 m is extremely close, which indicates an immediate collision risk. DTClat of -2.21 m means the obstacle is ahead and slightly to the right.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1
  - **Time Risk reason**: With a Vrel_long of -0.64 m/s, the TTC is very short, leading to an imminent collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 1
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 20027.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: DTClong of 8.74 m indicates close proximity, suggesting heightened collision risk. DTClat of -11.79 m shows it is ahead and further to the right.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity suggests that the obstacle is closing in at a consistent rate; however, the situation is manageable with quick reaction.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 20030.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: DTClong of 14.71 m suggests moderate distance with some risk but moderate control margin. DTClat of -18.44 m indicates it's far to the right.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Given the relative velocity and acceleration, the collision risk is moderate but controllable with timely response.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 20033.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: DTClong of 19.37 m indicates a reasonable distance allowing for reactions. DTClat of -23.63 m positions it to the right, decreasing lateral risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: The longitudinal velocity is low, offering time to maneuver and avoid a collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20035.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: DTClong of 24.03 m is adequate, which provides buffer space for safety. DTClat of -28.82 m confirms it's comfortably to the right.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Safe with a consistent approach rate that allows for intervention.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20037.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: DTClong of 28.69 m offers safe space between vehicles. DTClat of -34.01 m suggests it's well to the right.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Slow approach rate ensures negligible collision risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20042.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: DTClong of 33.43 m is considered secure. DTClat of -39.29 m indicates a significant safe lateral buffer.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Despite a moderate approach rate, plenty of time to react due to its distance.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20045.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: DTClong of 39.52 m confirms it maintains a safe distance, but lateral motion shows some risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Fast lateral approach suggests moderate risk requiring monitoring.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20080.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Exact longitudinal alignment (0 m), with DTClat of 4.44 m, indicates high proximity laterally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2
  - **Time Risk reason**: Relative lateral velocity requires immediate attention, as TTC is low.
  - **Time safety score**: 2
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 20094.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Exact alignment with slight lateral gap (0.01 m) makes collision highly likely if not adjusted immediately.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1
  - **Time Risk reason**: With Vrel_lat of -1.1 m/s, the TTC is almost immediate, posing extreme risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 1
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1
