### Safety analysis for timestep 9.2s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**General Notes:**  Since no ego vehicle information is provided, assumptions must be made. We will assume the ego vehicle is stationary for simplification, although this is unlikely realistic.  Therefore, relative velocities and accelerations are equal to the obstacle's absolute values.  Also, lateral movement toward the ego vehicle increases risk, even if the longitudinal motion is away.

**Methodology:**  A simplified TTC calculation will be used due to the lack of ego vehicle information: `TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity`. We'll consider both longitudinal and lateral TTC (TTClong, TTClat).  MDC is simply the current distance, either longitudinal, lateral, or a combination based on the obstacle's position and movement.

- **Obstacle ID: 20020.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Extremely close longitudinally (0.15m) and to the front-right.  Essentially a collision.
    - Distance safety score: 0
    - Time Risk reason:  Negative longitudinal velocity means approaching quickly.  TTClong ~0.23s.
    - Time safety score: 0
    - Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 20027.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Relatively close longitudinally (8.74m) and to the front-right. High risk of collision.
    - Distance safety score: 2
    - Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal velocity indicates approach. TTClong ~13.65s. However, continued approach could lead to collision given the lateral position.
    - Time safety score: 2
    - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 20030.0** through **Obstacle ID: 20071.0 (excluding 20074.0 and 20042, 20045, 20048, 20050, 20053)**
    - Distance Risk reason: Increasingly further away, longitudinally and laterally.
    - Distance safety score: 3-5 (increasing with distance)
    - Time Risk reason:  Negative longitudinal velocity indicates approach but ample time. TTClong varies but is greater than that of closer obstacles. 
    - Time safety score: 3-5 (increasing with distance)
    - Overall Risk score: 3-5 (increasing with distance)

- **Obstacle ID: 20042.0, 20045.0, 20048.0, 20050.0, 20053.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Moderate to far longitudinal distance but lateral motion toward ego increases risk.
- Distance safety score: 3-4
- Time Risk reason:  Complex due to combined longitudinal and lateral movement. Lateral TTClat needs detailed calculation, but lateral movement toward the ego is a concern.
- Time safety score: 3-4
- Overall Risk score: 3-4


- **Obstacle ID: 20074.0**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Moderately far and moving away longitudinally.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, decreasing risk.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 20077.0** and **Obstacle ID: 20078.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Far and moving away.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away, no risk.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5


- **Obstacle ID: 20080.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Laterally very close (4.44m) and moving closer.  High risk.
    - Distance safety score: 1
    - Time Risk reason: Lateral velocity indicates imminent lateral collision risk.  TTClat ~7.4s (if ego is stationary), but with acceleration this will shorten.
    - Time safety score: 1
    - Overall Risk score: 1


- **Obstacle ID: 20082.0** through **Obstacle ID: 20100.0 (excluding 20094.0 and 20096.0)**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Moderate to far distances but some lateral motion towards ego requires attention.
    - Distance safety score: 2-5 (increasing with distance)
    - Time Risk reason:  TTClong varies considerably, but lateral motion towards ego modifies risk.  Needs careful monitoring.
    - Time safety score: 2-5 (increasing with distance)
    - Overall Risk score: 2-5 (increasing with distance)


- **Obstacle ID: 20094.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Extremely close laterally (0.01m) with lateral movement indicates near collision.
    - Distance safety score: 0
    - Time Risk reason: Lateral velocity implies imminent collision. TTClat ~ 0.009s.
    - Time safety score: 0
    - Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 20096.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Relatively close behind and to the side (10.03m longitudinally, 11.6m laterally).  Lateral movement towards ego increases risk.
    - Distance safety score: 2
    - Time Risk reason: Lateral velocity increases risk; longitudinal velocity decreasing risk slightly. Overall TTC requires detailed calculation.
    - Time safety score: 2
    - Overall Risk score: 2
