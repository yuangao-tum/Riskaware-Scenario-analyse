### Safety analysis for timestep 2.5 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
We'll calculate the Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) for each obstacle and then evaluate the risk associated.

**Formulas used:**
1. **TTC (Time to Collision)**:
   - TTC_long = DTClong / Vrel_long (if Vrel_long is not zero)
   - TTC_lat = DTClat / Vrel_lat (if Vrel_lat is not zero)
   
2. **MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision)**:
   - MDC = sqrt(DTClong² + DTClat²)

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30743.0
- Distance Risk reason: Exact longitudinal and lateral alignment at 0.0 m puts the vehicle in immediate danger.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: TTC_long = 0.0 / 3.57 = 0.0 s (collision imminent).
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1 (immediate collision risk).

#### Obstacle 30744.0
- Distance Risk reason: At 55.81 m longitudinal and moving away, minimal immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: TTC_long = 55.81 / 7.02 = 7.94 s, moving away minimizes collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4.

#### Obstacle 30745.0
- Distance Risk reason: At 80.12 m, longitudinal distance allows ample reaction time.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: TTC_long = 80.12 / 7.61 = 10.52 s (safe distance).
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4.

#### Obstacle 30747.0
- Distance Risk reason: 11.63 m longitudinally towards the vehicle, posing a significant threat.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: TTC_long = 11.63 / 9.02 = 1.29 s, close to collision.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2.

#### Obstacle 30748.0
- Distance Risk reason: 10.09 m directly behind the ego car, close proximity brings additional risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: TTC_long = 10.09 / 2.24 = 4.5 s, although safe for now, significant risk due to closeness.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 2.

#### Obstacle 30750.0
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close at 0.0 m longitudinally, representing serious risk.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: TTC_long = 0.0 / -9.95 (the vehicle is moving towards ego) implies imminent risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1 (immediate collision risk).

#### Obstacle 30751.0
- Distance Risk reason: 35.68 m ahead, but moving towards the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: TTC_long = 35.68 / -3.16 results in negative time (imminent collision risk).
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1 (immediate collision risk).

#### Obstacle 30752.0
- Distance Risk reason: Significant distance of 28.89 m from behind, manageable.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: TTC_long = 28.89 / 0.71 = 40.7 s (very safe).
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4.

#### Obstacle 30753.0
- Distance Risk reason: Alligned longitudinally with a distance of 49.05 m.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: TTC_long = 49.05 / -5.72 provides imminent risk (negative).
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1 (immediate collision risk).

#### Obstacle 30754.0
- Distance Risk reason: 19.58 m from behind, reasonable space.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: TTC_long = 19.58 / 1.22 = 16.05 s.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4.

#### Obstacle 30757.0
- Distance Risk reason: 62.71 m distant and lateral to left, safe situation.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: TTC_long = 62.71 / -6.67 implies imminent risk (negative).
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1 (immediate collision risk).

#### Obstacle 30760.0
- Distance Risk reason: Distance of 19.15 m lateral right, non-threatening.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Suitable TTC calculations, lengths safe.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4.

#### Obstacle 30766.0
- Distance Risk reason: 19.61 m distance from the car, safe.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  TTC_long calculations, well over safe.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4.

#### Obstacle 30770.0
- Distance Risk reason: 8.54 m close but not launching a threat given lateral range.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Close calculations, but still manageable distances.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3.
