### Safety analysis for timestep 2.5s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**Calculations Note:**  TTC is calculated as |Distance| / |Relative Velocity| if the relative velocity indicates the objects are moving towards each other. If the relative velocity shows they are moving apart, TTC is considered infinite (practically represented by a high value like 999 indicating no immediate risk). If the distance is 0 and relative velocity is towards each other, TTC is 0.  MDC is the minimum absolute distance, either longitudinal or lateral, during the potential collision time window.  In this analysis, if DTClong or DTClat are 0, we assume a collision is happening or imminent, resulting in an overall score of 0.

- **Obstacle ID: 30743.0**
- Distance Risk reason: DTClong and DTClat are both 0, indicating a collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Collision imminent.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 30744.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far away, moving away longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away, no TTC risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30745.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Far away, moving away in both directions.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away, no TTC risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30747.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Safe longitudinal distance, but lateral distance is moderate and decreasing.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Laterally converging, TTClat = |15.9| / |0.42| = 37.8s. Not an immediate concern.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30748.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Longitudinally close and approaching. Lateral distance is 0.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Approaching from behind, TTClong = |-10.09| / |2.24| = 4.5s. Lateral collision imminent.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30749.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderate distance but moving away longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away, no TTC risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30750.0**
- Distance Risk reason: DTClong is 0, lateral distance is moderate but decreasing.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  Collision imminent longitudinally. TTClat = |17.1| / |0.6| = 28.5s.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1
