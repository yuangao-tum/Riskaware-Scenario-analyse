### Safety analysis for timestep 2.5: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

---

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30743
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is exactly 0.0 m longitudinally and laterally positioned, indicating it is within the bounds of collision.
- **Distance safety score**: 0 (Collision)
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocities indicate that the ego vehicle is moving towards the obstacle at 3.57 m/s longitudinally with no lateral distance. Immediate action is required, as collision is imminent.
- **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 0 (Collision)

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30744
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is 55.81 m longitudinally and 1.95 m laterally distant, which poses minimal risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: With a longitudinal velocity of 7.02 m/s and moving away, there is controlled time to react sufficiently before any collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30745
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at 80.12 m longitudinally and 2.73 m laterally, presenting a low risk of colliding.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away at a velocity of 7.61 m/s, suggesting minimal concern with enough time to adjust.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30747
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is longitudinally -11.63 m and laterally 15.9 m distant, indicating potential danger as it is getting closer.
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: With a relative velocity of -9.02 m/s longitudinally, it indicates urgency as it is rapidly approaching the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 2 (High Risk)

---

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30748
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is longitudinally -10.09 m and laterally 0.0 m, indicating a critical condition.
- **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Relative longitudinal velocity of 2.24 m/s towards the ego vehicle necessitates immediate maneuvering to avoid collision.
- **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 0 (Collision)

---

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30750
- **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinally at 0.0 m and laterally 17.1 m; this indicates that the vehicle is moving into the space where the ego car may encounter it.
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The significant negative longitudinal relative velocity of -9.95 m/s shows an urgent need to navigate to prevent collision.
- **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 2 (High Risk)

---

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30751
- **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinally 35.68 m and laterally 17.92 m away represents a low risk situation.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity suggests a slower approach to the ego car, giving enough time to react.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

---

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30752
- **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinally -28.89 m and laterally 0.0 m indicate it is significantly encroaching on the ego vehicle's path.
- **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The low velocities also imply rapid closure; thus, immediate corrective action is necessary.
- **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 0 (Collision)
