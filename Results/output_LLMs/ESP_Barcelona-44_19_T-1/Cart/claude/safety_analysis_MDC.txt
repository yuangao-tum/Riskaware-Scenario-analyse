Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.5 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario for potential collisions:

### Key Findings:
1. Ego vehicle is in lanelet 1665, moving at a relatively low speed (~1.18 m/s)
2. Most relevant obstacles are:
   - Obstacle 30743: In the same lanelet (1665)
   - Obstacle 30744: In adjacent lanelet
   - Other vehicles are in different lanelets with safe distances

### Detailed Safety Analysis:

For Obstacle 30743:
- Distance Risk Reason: In same lanelet, starting ~5.4m ahead of ego vehicle, moving in same direction
- Distance Safety Score: 3 (Medium risk due to same lanelet occupancy)
- Time Risk Reason: Relative velocity is positive (obstacle moving faster than ego), increasing separation
- Time Safety Score: 4 (Low risk due to increasing separation)
- Overall Risk Score: 3 (Medium risk)

For Obstacle 30744:
- Distance Risk Reason: In adjacent lanelet, ~30m lateral distance
- Distance Safety Score: 5 (Safe distance maintained)
- Time Risk Reason: Different trajectory paths, no intersection point
- Time Safety Score: 5 (No risk of collision)
- Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible risk)

All other obstacles:
- Distance Safety Score: 5 (Safe distances maintained)
- Time Safety Score: 5 (No immediate collision risks)
- Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Reasoning:
1. No imminent collisions detected (no score of 0)
2. No extreme risk situations (no score of 1)
3. The closest interaction (Obstacle 30743) maintains safe separation
4. Other vehicles are following their designated paths with adequate spacing
5. Ego vehicle's low speed provides good maneuverability and reaction time

The scenario shows normal traffic flow with acceptable safety margins for all vehicles involved.
