Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.5 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.5 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Important Notes:
- **DTClong and TTClong** refer to longitudinal direction (parallel to the movement).
- **DTClat and TTClat** refer to lateral direction (perpendicular to the movement).

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30743.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is relatively close in position (approximately 5.29m away).
- **Distance Safety Score**: 2 (High Risk due to proximity and same lane)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Higher velocity of obstacle potentially reduces longitudinal TTC significantly.
- **Time Safety Score**: 2 (High Risk due to high velocity in the same direction)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 30744.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (1669.0) and at a substantial initial distance.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: High velocity, but different lanelet minimizes collision possibility.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30745.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle is relatively far and in a different lanelet.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Different trajectory paths result in negligible TTC impact.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30747.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet, moving away from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Opposite orientation and lane make collision highly unlikely.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30748.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Located in a different lanelet with a slightly increasing distance.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Slower velocity and the different lanelet make collision improbable.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30749.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Different lanelet and significant distance.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: High velocity sideways to ego vehicle trajectory.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30750.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Different lanelet, travelling in a different direction.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: High transverse velocity reduces interaction possibility.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30751.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Different trajectory, decelerating and moving away.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Low velocity with a decelerating trend reduces collision chances.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30752.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Different lanelet and far from ego vehicle.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Both vehicles are moving in transverse direction.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30753.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Different lanelet, decelerating and moving away.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: High velocity but in a non-colliding trajectory.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Remaining Obstacles (30754.0 to 30772.0)
- Generally, these obstacles are in different lanelets, with either higher relocating velocity components, further distances, or deviating trajectories. They collectively represent low to negligible risk levels concerning the ego vehicle, yielding a Distance/Time Safety Score of 4 or 5, leading to an overall risk score of 4 or 5.

**Conclusion**: At this time step, no obstacles present an overall risk score of 0 (Collision) or 1 (Extreme Risk). The primary concern is with Obstacle ID 30743.0, which presents a high risk due to lanelet and proximity, but does not reach the extreme or collision threshold. Other obstacles are moving away or are distanced enough, minimizing their collision impact.
