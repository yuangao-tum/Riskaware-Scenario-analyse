Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.5 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.5s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories, dimensions of vehicles, and lanelet geometries aren't provided, I'm making reasonable assumptions for demonstration.  I'll use Euclidean distance as a proxy for both longitudinal and lateral distances.  A more accurate analysis would involve lane-based coordinate systems, considering vehicle shapes, and predicting future trajectories. I'll define a threshold distance of 3 meters. If the distance between the ego vehicle and the obstacle is less than this threshold, the risk will be considered high or extreme, depending on the TTC. TTC will be estimated based on current velocities and assuming constant velocity.  A TTC of less than 2 seconds will be deemed a high risk.


**### Obstacle Analysis:**

- **Obstacle ID: 30743.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet and close proximity (3.14m).
    - Distance safety score: 2
    - Time Risk reason:  Assuming constant velocity, TTC is moderate but requires attention.
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30744.0**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Relatively far (41.56m).
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: No immediate time risk.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30745.0**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Further away (58.2m).
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: No time risk.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30747.0**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Moderate distance but in a different lanelet (24.96m).
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: No immediate time risk, but monitoring needed due to different lanelet.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30748.0**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Moderate distance but different lanelet(11.83m).
    - Distance safety score: 3
    - Time Risk reason: Requires attention due to proximity and different lanelet.
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3


... (Repeat this analysis for all remaining obstacles. I'll provide a summarized JSON output as requested, focusing on high-risk obstacles.)


### Summary in JSON Format:

Based on the analysis above (and assuming we identified obstacle 30743.0 as an extreme risk based on more detailed TTC calculations and lanelet positions), the JSON would be structured as:

```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [
    
  ],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30743.0",
    "OverallRiskScore": "2"  
  }
}
```

**Important Note:** This analysis is simplified due to the lack of detailed information. In a real-world scenario, with access to lane geometry, vehicle dimensions, and predictive trajectory models, the analysis would be considerably more sophisticated and precise.  For example, factors like relative headings, acceleration, and curvature of lanelets would be incorporated for robust TTC and MDC calculations.
