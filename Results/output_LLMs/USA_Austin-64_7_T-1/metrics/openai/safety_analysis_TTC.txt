Safety analysis for timestep 4.3 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.3: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3332
  - Relative Direction: Front-right
  - Distance Risk Reason: DTC values are 19.0 (longitudinal) and 8.85 (lateral), which indicate that there is minimal risk of collision given the substantial distances. 
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4
  - Time Risk Reason: TTC values are 6.77 (longitudinal) and Infinity (lateral), suggesting no imminent collision risk due to enough time to react.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 4
  - Overall Risk Score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3334
  - Relative Direction: Front-left
  - Distance Risk Reason: DTC values of 9.72 (longitudinal) and 1.89 (lateral) indicate a manageable situation since longitudinal distance is ample, but there is some concern regarding the lateral distance.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 3  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 2
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 2.5 (rounded down to 2)
  - Time Risk Reason: TTC values are 3.47 (longitudinal) and Infinity (lateral), indicating some risk, but not immediate as ample time is available longitudinally.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 4
  - Overall Risk Score: (2 * 0.5 + 4 * 0.5) = 3

- Obstacle ID: 3335
  - Relative Direction: Front
  - Distance Risk Reason: DTC values of 9.74 (longitudinal) and 0.0 (lateral) indicate a direct risk of collision due to the lateral distance being zero.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 3  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.5 (rounded down to 1)
  - Time Risk Reason: TTC values are 3.47 (longitudinal) and 0.0 (lateral), which denotes immediate risk due to the lateral time being zero.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 1.5 (rounded down to 1)
  - Overall Risk Score: (1 * 0.5 + 1 * 0.5) = 1

- Obstacle ID: 3336
  - Relative Direction: Front-right
  - Distance Risk Reason: DTC values of 22.5 (longitudinal) and 8.97 (lateral) show negligible risk since both distances are ample.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5 (rounded down to 4)
  - Time Risk Reason: TTC values of 8.02 (longitudinal) and Infinity (lateral) don't indicate any imminent risk, showing sufficient time to react.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Risk Score: 4.5 (rounded down to 4)

- Obstacle ID: 3337
  - Relative Direction: Front-left
  - Distance Risk Reason: DTC values of 0.45 (longitudinal) and 1.89 (lateral) signify critical risk due to the very short longitudinal distance.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 2
  - Time Risk Reason: TTC values of 0.38 (longitudinal) and Infinity (lateral) indicate immediate danger as the longitudinal time to collision is also very low.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 3
  - Overall Risk Score: (2 * 0.5 + 3 * 0.5) = 2.5 (rounded down to 2)

- Obstacle ID: 3338
  - Relative Direction: Front
  - Distance Risk Reason: DTC values of 0.19 (longitudinal) and 0.0 (lateral) indicate a critical risk as both distances are too small to avoid collision.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.5 (rounded down to 0)
  - Time Risk Reason: TTC values of 0.19 (longitudinal) and 0.0 (lateral) further exacerbate the risk, confirming immediate collision risk.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 0.5 (rounded down to 0)
  - Overall Risk Score: 0.5 (rounded down to 0)

- Obstacle ID: 3340
  - Relative Direction: Rear-left
  - Distance Risk Reason: DTC of 2.02 (longitudinal) and 1.87 (lateral) indicates moderate risk as the distances are fairly close.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 3  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 2
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 2.5 (rounded down to 2)
  - Time Risk Reason: TTC values of 3.96 (longitudinal) and Infinity (lateral) indicate that while there is some risk, it is low and manageable with sufficient time to react.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5 (rounded down to 4)
  - Overall Risk Score: (2 * 0.5 + 4 * 0.5) = 3
