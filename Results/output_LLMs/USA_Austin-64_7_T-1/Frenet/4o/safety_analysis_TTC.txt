### Safety analysis for timestep 4.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 3332.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** With a longitudinal distance of 19.0 m, the obstacle is in the front-right. The lateral distance of -8.85 m indicates it's not directly in front.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Relative longitudinal velocity of -2.81 m/s indicates the obstacle is approaching. TTClong ≈ 19.0 / 2.81 ≈ 6.76 s
   - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 3334.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance is only 9.72 m in the front-left; moderate risk due to proximity.
   - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** With a relative velocity of -2.81 m/s, TTClong ≈ 9.72 / 2.81 ≈ 3.46 s
   - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 3335.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Nearly identical evaluation to 3334.0 since it's front-centered at 9.74 m.
   - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** TTClong ≈ 9.74 / 2.81 ≈ 3.47 s
   - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 3336.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Being 22.5 m away in the front-right with lateral distance of -8.97 m, obstacle is at low risk.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** TTClong ≈ 22.5 / 2.81 ≈ 8.01 s
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 3337.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Extremely proximal at 0.45 m front-left, very high collision zone.
   - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** TTClong ≈ 0.45 / 1.18 ≈ 0.38 s
   - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID: 3338.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Only 0.19 m front, high probability of immediate collision.
   - **Distance safety score:** 0 (Collision)
   - **Time Risk reason:** TTClong ≈ 0.19 / 0.97 ≈ 0.20 s
   - **Time safety score:** 0 (Collision)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 0 (Collision)

7. **Obstacle ID: 3340.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Although it's behind at -2.02 m, it's moving away laterally, lowering collision concerns.
   - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Due to being in the rear and moving laterally away, substantial risk reduction.
   - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
