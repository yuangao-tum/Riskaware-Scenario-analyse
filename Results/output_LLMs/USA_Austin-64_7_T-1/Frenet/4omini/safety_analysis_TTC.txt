### Safety analysis for timestep 4.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3332.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is 19.0 m and lateral distance is -8.85 m. The obstacle is positioned in the front-right, which indicates it is relatively far enough not to interfere significantly.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The relative longitudinal velocity is -2.81 m/s. The Time To Collision (TTC) longitudinally could be calculated as:
    \[
    TTC_{long} = \frac{DTClong}{|Vrel\_long|} = \frac{19.0}{2.81} \approx 6.76 \text{ seconds}
    \]
    Since TTC is greater than 5 seconds, the collision risk is minimal.
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3334.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is 9.72 m and lateral distance is 1.89 m. The obstacle is in the front-left position, considerably close.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The relative longitudinal velocity is again -2.81 m/s. The TTC can be calculated as:
    \[
    TTC_{long} = \frac{DTClong}{|Vrel\_long|} = \frac{9.72}{2.81} \approx 3.45 \text{ seconds}
    \]
    While this indicates moderate risk, it is manageable with timely reactions.
  - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3335.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance is 9.74 m and lateral distance is 0.0 m, indicating a direct front position.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The collision time calculation is similar:
    \[
    TTC_{long} = \frac{9.74}{2.81} \approx 3.47 \text{ seconds}
    \]
    Moderate risk due to being directly in front with a short TTC.
  - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3336.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is 22.5 m and lateral distance is -8.97 m. The obstacle is in the front-right, indicating it is safely distanced.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** 
    \[
    TTC_{long} = \frac{22.5}{2.81} \approx 8.01 \text{ seconds}
    \]
    Indicates a very low likelihood of collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3337.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is 0.45 m and lateral distance is 1.89 m. This proximity classifies this as close and concerning.
  - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The velocity can be calculated:
    \[
    TTC_{long} = \frac{0.45}{1.18} \approx 0.38 \text{ seconds}
    \]
    Immediate action is required due to the very short TTC.
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3338.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is 0.19 m and lateral distance is 0.0 m, indicating an impending collision.
  - **Distance safety score:** 0 (Collision)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Calculating TTC for this scenario:
    \[
    TTC_{long} = \frac{0.19}{0.97} \approx 0.20 \text{ seconds}
    \]
    Immediate urgent action is necessary to prevent collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 0 (Collision)

- **Obstacle ID: 3340.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is -2.02 m and lateral distance is 1.87 m signifies an approaching obstacle from behind.
  - **Distance safety score:** 1 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Analyzing the TTC:
    \[
    TTC_{long} = \frac{-2.02}{0.51} \text{ seconds (not calculable for Collision)}
    \]
    Indicates a risk of collision with immediate action required.
  - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
