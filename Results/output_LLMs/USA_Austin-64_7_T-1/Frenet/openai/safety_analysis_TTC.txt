### Safety analysis for timestep 4.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 3332.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance is 19.0 m and lateral distance is -8.85 m. The obstacle is in the front-right, which indicates a moderate risk since it is moving toward the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocity towards the car is -2.81 m/s. The time to collision can be calculated as \( TTC_{long} = \frac{DTClong}{|Vrel_{long}|} = \frac{19.0}{2.81} \approx 6.76 \) seconds and \( TTC_{lat} \) > 10 seconds (since it is moving laterally away). This indicates a minimal risk of immediate impact.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 3334.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance is 9.72 m and lateral distance is 1.89 m. The obstacle is in the front-left and is moving towards the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Relative velocity is -2.81 m/s. Using the same formula: \( TTC_{long} = \frac{9.72}{2.81} \approx 3.45 \) seconds; this indicates a manageable collision risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 3335.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is 9.74 m and lateral distance is 0.0 m. Directly in front, this situation poses a significant risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Same relative velocity of -2.81 m/s gives \( TTC_{long} = 3.46 \) seconds indicating a high collision risk given the proximity.
  - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 3336.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is 22.5 m and lateral distance is -8.97 m. Moving toward the ego vehicle could indicate a low risk since it is further away.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Relative velocity of -2.81 m/s yields \( TTC_{long} \approx 8.01 \) seconds, suggesting sufficient time to react.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 3337.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance of 0.45 m and lateral distance is 1.89 m. This obstacle is very close (dangerously so) but moving slightly away laterally.
  - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** With a longitudinal velocity of -1.18 m/s, \( TTC_{long} = \frac{0.45}{1.18} \approx 0.38 \) seconds indicating an immediate risk of collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 3338.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is 0.19 m and lateral distance is 0.0 m. Directly in front and extremely close to the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal velocity of -0.97 m/s gives \( TTC_{long} \approx 0.20 \) seconds, indicating an imminent danger.
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 3340.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is -2.02 m indicating it is now behind the ego vehicle (considered but not a frontal collision risk).
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The vehicle is moving away from the ego car, thus ensuring no collision is imminent.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
