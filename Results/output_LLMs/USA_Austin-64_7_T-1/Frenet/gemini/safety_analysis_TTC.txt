### Safety analysis for timestep 4.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3332.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Longitudinal distance is moderately safe (19m), lateral distance is safe (8.85m), and the obstacle is front-right.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (-2.81 m/s) but with positive acceleration (0.43 m/s²), suggesting the closing speed might decrease.  Lateral movement is not a concern.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3334.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is relatively close (9.72m) while lateral distance is safe (1.89m), and the obstacle is front-left.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (-2.81 m/s) with slight positive acceleration (0.43 m/s²). Lateral movement is not a concern.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


- **Obstacle ID: 3335.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is close (9.74m), no lateral distance, and the obstacle is directly in front.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (-2.81 m/s) with a slight positive acceleration (0.43 m/s²). No lateral movement.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


- **Obstacle ID: 3336.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Safe longitudinal (22.5m) and lateral (8.97m) distances, and the obstacle is front-right.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (-2.81 m/s) with slight positive acceleration (0.43 m/s²). No lateral movement.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 3337.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close longitudinally (0.45m) with a small lateral distance (1.89m) at the front-left.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Approaching slowly longitudinally (-1.18 m/s) with a slight positive acceleration (0.15 m/s²). Moving away laterally.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 1


- **Obstacle ID: 3338.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close longitudinally (0.19m) with no lateral distance directly in front.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Approaching very slowly longitudinally (-0.97 m/s) with a slight negative acceleration (-0.08 m/s²). No lateral movement.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1


- **Obstacle ID: 3340.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Slightly behind (-2.02m) with a safe lateral distance (1.87m) at the rear-left.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally (0.51 m/s) with minimal acceleration. Moving away laterally.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4
