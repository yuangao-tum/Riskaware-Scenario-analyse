Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
#### Obstacle ID: 3332.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle is located at (500.6189, 393.3831), which is far from the ego vehicle's coordinates (483.4154, 374.2519) and is not in the same lanelet. There is a significant distance longitudinally.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle is stationary with a velocity of 0.0, meaning no relative motion towards the ego vehicle.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3334.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle is located at (484.4801, 388.8699), with a slight lateral distance to the ego vehicle's path but not in the same lanelet, minimizing immediate collision risk.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle is stationary with a velocity of 0.0, and there is no immediate longitudinal threat.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3335.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Located at (487.8118, 387.7994), this obstacle is stationary and not in the same lanelet, so has a moderate distance.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Velocity of 0.0 suggests no immediate collision risk, both in DTC and TTC.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3336.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned at (501.8163, 396.6737) with considerable longitudinal and lateral separation and not on the direct path.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Stationary obstacle, so lateral and longitudinal risk minimal.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3337.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: At (481.6166, 380.048), with some proximity in the lateral direction, but moving at 1.6253 in a similar orientation.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Has potential lateral movement towards the ego vehicle; should be closely monitored, but speed suggests manageable risk.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 3338.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Found at (484.863, 378.7181) in the same lanelet (462.0) as the ego vehicle and relatively close.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3
- **Time Risk Reason**: Moving slightly towards the ego vehicle with a velocity of 1.8368, potential risk requires monitoring.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 3340.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned at (478.0868, 369.1186), with some proximity, but moving away with velocity +3.3159.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Moving slightly faster than ego vehicle, reducing potential collision risk long term.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4
