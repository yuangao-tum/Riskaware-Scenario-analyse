Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.3 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario for potential collisions:

### Safety Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 3338.0 (Most Critical)**:
- Located in same lanelet (462.0) as ego vehicle
- Distance Risk reason: Starting at ~7m behind ego vehicle, maintaining close following distance throughout
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity decreasing but maintaining close following distance
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

2. **Obstacle 3337.0**:
- Located in adjacent lanelet (461.0)
- Distance Risk reason: Maintaining safe lateral distance
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: No immediate collision risk
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

3. **Obstacle 3340.0**:
- Located in lanelet 461.0
- Distance Risk reason: Safe lateral and longitudinal separation
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: No immediate collision risk
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

4. **Static Obstacles (3332.0, 3334.0, 3335.0, 3336.0)**:
- Located in different lanelets
- Distance Risk reason: Far from ego vehicle's path
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: No collision path
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Key Findings:
1. No immediate collision risk detected (score 0)
2. No extreme risk obstacles detected (score 1)
3. Obstacle 3338.0 presents the highest risk but maintains a manageable distance
4. All other vehicles maintain safe distances and speeds
5. Static obstacles pose no risk to ego vehicle's trajectory

The scenario shows moderate risk levels but no immediate collision dangers. The ego vehicle's deceleration pattern suggests appropriate defensive driving behavior.
