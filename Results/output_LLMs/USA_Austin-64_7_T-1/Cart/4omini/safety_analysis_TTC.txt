Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.3 seconds):
Given the scenario and the necessary steps to conduct a collision analysis, let's first identify the obstacles that are either in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle or on a potential collision trajectory.

**Identifying Obstacles in Lanelet 462:**
1. **Obstacle 3338** (484.863, 378.7181, Velocity: 1.8368, Acceleration: -1.6517)
2. **Obstacle 3334** (484.4801, 388.8699, Velocity: 0.0, Acceleration: 0.0)

**Calculating Metrics for Each Obstacle:**

### Safety analysis for timestep 4.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

**1. Obstacle ID: 3338**
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The distance to the obstacle is calculated considering the dTClong (longitudinal distance) and dTClat (lateral distance). Given the current position of the ego vehicle and this obstacle, the unique distance measures indicate a potential close encounter.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 
  - Minimum Distance: 3.5 meters to obstacle 3338
  - Score: **2** (High Risk)
  
- **Time Risk Reason**: The TTC for this scenario considering the obstacleâ€™s speed and the ego vehicle's deceleration suggests that a collision may likely occur within an unmanageable time frame given the current speed and actions.
- **Time Safety Score**:
  - TTC: 2 seconds based on ego vehicle velocity and deceleration.
  - Score: **2** (High Risk)

- **Overall Risk Score**: Average of Distance (2) and Time (2): **2** (High Risk)

**2. Obstacle ID: 3334**
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The distance to this obstacle is also approaching but is currently not in a direct path of collision. As it is stationary, the likelihood grows as the ego approaches.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 
  - Minimum Distance: 1.5 meters to obstacle 3334
  - Score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
  
- **Time Risk Reason**: Being stationary and very close to the ego vehicle, the time to collision is critically short as the ego vehicle does not have significant space to maneuver.
- **Time Safety Score**:
  - TTC: 1 second due to the speed of ego vehicle approaching the stationary obstacle.
  - Score: **1** (Extreme Risk)

- **Overall Risk Score**: Average of Distance (1) and Time (1): **1** (Extreme Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format: 
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3334",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
```

In summary, obstacle 3334 presents an extreme risk of collision and requires immediate attention, whereas obstacle 3338 poses a high risk warranting swift maneuvering by the ego vehicle. There are no additional collision obstacles identified.
