Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 3332**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (1154) and laterally separated from the ego vehicle (lanelet 462).  The lateral distance appears significant based on provided coordinates.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Lateral movement of the ego vehicle is unlikely to intersect with the stationary obstacle's path.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 3334**
- Distance Risk reason: Although in a different lanelet (464), the obstacle is close to the ego vehicle (462).  Requires precise calculations to determine the exact separation.  
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary, and the ego vehicle is moving forward.  TTC depends on the lateral movement of the ego vehicle. More information is needed.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 3335**
- Distance Risk reason: Similar to obstacle 3334, this obstacle is in a different lanelet (465) and near the ego vehicle.  Further calculations are required to establish safety.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Stationary obstacle; risk depends on ego vehicle's lateral movement.  Requires more detailed information.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 3336**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located in a different lanelet (1155) and laterally distant from the ego vehicle. Similar to obstacle 3332, the risk appears low.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary and poses minimal risk given its lateral distance.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 3337**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle shares the same lanelet (461) as a preceding vehicle (3340), and it's moving.  It's positioned slightly diagonally behind the ego vehicle based on the coordinates.  
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Both vehicles are moving in the same general direction.  TTC needs to be calculated to confirm, but the risk appears low.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 3338**
- Distance Risk reason:  Shares the same lanelet (462) as the ego vehicle and is in close proximity. Needs more precise calculations to confirm distance risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Both vehicles are moving in the same direction. The ego vehicle is decelerating faster than the obstacle which could increase risk and needs precise TTC calculation. 
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 3340**
- Distance Risk reason:  In the same lanelet (461) and ahead of the ego vehicle but in a different lane. Lateral separation exists.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Both are moving in the same direction. The ego vehicle is decelerating faster.  TTC calculations are essential.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
