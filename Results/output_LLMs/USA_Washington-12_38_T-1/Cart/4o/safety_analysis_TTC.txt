Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.3: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30604**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is located at a significant distance both longitudinally and laterally from the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle has a higher speed than the ego vehicle, but due to the substantial distance and different lanelet, there is ample time to react.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30605**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is stationary and located significantly to the side, not in the direct path of the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Since the obstacle is stationary and off-path, it poses no time-based collision threat.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30606**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: While on a different lanelet, it is moving relatively fast but is positioned further away longitudinally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Higher speed than the ego vehicle but situated in a different trajectory; time to react is adequate.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30607**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned laterally away with a distinct path; minimal collision likelihood.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Despite a moderate speed, the lateral distance ensures a long time to potential collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30608**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary and on a different lanelet, far from the ego vehicle's path.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: No significant time-based collision risk due to stationary state and off-path location.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30609**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Slow speed and not in the direct trajectory of the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Minimal speed implies that there is negligible time-based collision threat.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30610**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary and not on the path of the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Given its stationary position and off-line trajectory, it poses no time-based threat.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30611**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Slow-moving and significantly lateral to the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: The low speed provides sufficient time to avoid any collision scenario.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30612**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Located on a distinct lanelet and moving at low speed away from the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Low speed ensures ample time for risk mitigation.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30613**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary obstacle located in a different position without direct interaction potential.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: No collision time concern due to negligible movement.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30614 to 30629**
  - **Distance and Time Risk analysis**: These obstacles exhibit similar parameters to those analyzed above, with zero or negligible movement, and positioned at a safe distance.
  - **Safety Scores (Distance, Time, Overall)**: Each of these obstacles receives a score of 5, indicating a negligible risk level.

### Summary in JSON Format: 

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

In conclusion, no obstacles were identified with collision risk (score 0) or extreme risk (score 1) for the given scenario. All obstacles are assessed to present negligible or low collision risks at the current time step.
