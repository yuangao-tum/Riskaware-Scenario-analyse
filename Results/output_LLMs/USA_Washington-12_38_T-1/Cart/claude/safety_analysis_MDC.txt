Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.3 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario for potential collisions:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Same Lanelet Analysis**:
- Ego vehicle is in lanelet 986
- Critical obstacles in same/adjacent lanelets:
  * Obstacle 30629 (same lanelet 986)
  * Obstacle 30626 (nearby lanelet 991)

2. **Critical Measurements**:

For Obstacle 30629:
- Initial longitudinal distance: ~20m
- Relative velocity: Decelerating
- TTC: >5s (safe margin)
- MDC: ~15m minimum separation

For Obstacle 30626:
- Different lanelet but converging trajectory
- Higher velocity but diverging path
- No immediate collision risk

3. **Risk Assessment By Time**:

From 0.0s to 3.3s:
- Obstacle 30629 maintains safe distance despite being in same lanelet
- Decelerating trend reduces risk
- No sudden trajectory changes
- Lateral separation maintained

### Safety Scores:

For Obstacle 30629:
- Distance Risk Reason: Maintains safe longitudinal separation >15m
- Distance Safety Score: 4
- Time Risk Reason: High TTC, decelerating relative velocity
- Time Safety Score: 4
- Overall Risk Score: 4

For Obstacle 30626:
- Distance Risk Reason: Different lanelet, diverging path
- Distance Safety Score: 5
- Time Risk Reason: No projected collision path
- Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Risk Score: 5

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

### Overall Assessment:
The scenario shows no immediate collision risks or extreme hazards. The main potential risk (Obstacle 30629) maintains safe separation and shows predictable deceleration behavior. All other vehicles maintain safe distances and trajectories.

The ego vehicle's path appears clear with adequate safety margins maintained throughout the observed time period. No emergency maneuvers are required based on current trajectories and velocities.
