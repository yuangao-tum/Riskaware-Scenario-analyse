Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**1. Identify obstacles in the same lanelet or trajectory as the ego vehicle.**
- The ego vehicle is currently in lanelet 986.0.
- We will focus on obstacles located in lanelet 986.0.

**2. Evaluate each obstacle:**
#### Obstacle 30629.0
- Position: (-137.6782, -94.7999)
- Distance Calculation:
  - Relative Position: |x_ego - x_obstacle| = |-137.538 - (-137.6782)| ≈ 0.14 meters
  - |y_ego - y_obstacle| = |-99.1464 - (-94.7999)| ≈ 4.35 meters
- Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) = √(0.14² + 4.35²) ≈ 4.35 meters
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle's x-coordinate is very close to the ego vehicle's while having a higher y-coordinate. 
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk) - Minimal collision risk detected.

- Time Calculation:
  - Longitudinal Velocity of the ego = 5.8518 m/s (negative acceleration suggests the ego vehicle is slowing) 
  - Longitudinal Velocity of the obstacle = 0.8877 m/s
  - Relative velocity in this direction = 5.8518 - 0.8877 ≈ 4.9641 m/s 
  - TTC Longitudinal = MDC / Relative velocity = 4.35 / 4.9641 ≈ 0.875 seconds 
  - **Time Risk reason:** The time to collision is on the order of less than a second, which is critical.
  - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk) - Close to collision detected.

- **Overall Risk score:** (Minimum of distance and time safety scores) = 2 (High Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
``` 

**Conclusion:** 
At this timestep, the only obstacle that poses a risk is obstacle 30629, which is rated as high risk due to the close potential collision timing. There are currently no obstacles with an overall risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk). The evaluation highlights the need for attentive maneuvering in anticipating the behavior of surrounding obstacles.
