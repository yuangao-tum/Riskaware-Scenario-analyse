Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories and dimensions of vehicles aren't provided, I'm making some simplifying assumptions for this analysis:

* **Point Objects:** Vehicles are treated as point objects.  A more realistic analysis would require vehicle dimensions and shapes.
* **Constant Velocity and Acceleration (Short Term):**  Over short time horizons (like those relevant for TTC calculations), I assume constant velocity and acceleration for a first-order approximation.
* **Lanelet-Based Risk:**  Lanelet information is crucial. Obstacles in different lanelets pose significantly less immediate risk, especially if the ego vehicle is not changing lanes.  I prioritize analyzing obstacles in the ego vehicle's lanelet (986).
* **Lateral Movement Not Explicitly Modeled:** I lack information on ego vehicle's steering angle or planned lane changes.  Lateral TTC and MDC are estimated based on current positions and velocities but could be inaccurate if a lane change is imminent.
