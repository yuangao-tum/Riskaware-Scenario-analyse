Safety analysis for timestep 3.3 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30604
  - Relative Direction: Rear-left
  - Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance (11.65) indicates the obstacle is far enough, and lateral distance (9.01) suggests a safe zone, posing negligible risk.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5
  - Time Risk Reason: Time to collision values are infinity for longitudinal, indicating no imminent threat, and TTC for the lateral (737.84) reinforces no immediate risk.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Risk Score: 5

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30605
  - Relative Direction: Front-left
  - Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal (12.16) distance is safe, however, the lack of lateral distance (17.69) and incoming longitudinal motion might imply caution.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Time Risk Reason: TTC for longitudinal (2.08) suggests potential risk, but the infinity for lateral indicates stability in space.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 2
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 3.5
  - Overall Risk Score: 4

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30606
  - Relative Direction: Rear-left
  - Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance indicates safety, lateral distance is near, but the obstacle is moving away, which minimizes risk.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4
  - Time Risk Reason: Same context as DTC; no imminent risk with infinite TTC.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Risk Score: 4

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30607
  - Relative Direction: Front-left
  - Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance (15.7) is well above the threshold with lateral distance (27.99) being generous, suggesting safety.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Time Risk Reason: TTC longitudinal (2.68), potential risk shows just enough time; lateral (infinity) shows security.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 2
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 3.5
  - Overall Risk Score: 4

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30608
  - Relative Direction: Front-left
  - Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal (27.95) and lateral (8.98) distances indicate a secure zone, overall positive outlook.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5
  - Time Risk Reason: TTC values signify no risk, especially given the infinity for lateral.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5
   - Overall Risk Score: 5

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30609
  - Relative Direction: Front-left
  - Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal (12.18) raises alarms while lateral (25.19) stays safe; overall gives some cautionary view.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal TTC value (2.08) indicates the need for concern; however, lateral stays infinity.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 2
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 3.5
  - Overall Risk Score: 4

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30610
  - Relative Direction: Front-left
  - Distance Risk Reason: Imminent danger as the longitudinal distance is minimal (0.22) leading to a high risk of collision.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1   
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 2.5
  - Time Risk Reason: Both longitudinal and lateral collision equate to instant peril.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 3
  - Overall Risk Score: 3

### Obstacle Analysis:
