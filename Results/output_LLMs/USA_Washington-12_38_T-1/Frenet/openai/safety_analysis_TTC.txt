### Safety analysis for timestep 3.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30604.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is -11.65 m longitudinally and 9.01 m laterally, suggesting it's relatively close but moving away longitudinally.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The longitudinal relative velocity (-19.65 m/s) and lateral motion (-0.01 m/s) indicates a potential approach, but it's moving away longitudinally, which allows time to react.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30605.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 12.16 m longitudinally and 17.69 m laterally away, significantly far.
  - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The longitudinal relative velocity is -5.85 m/s. So it is moving closer but safely at a distance.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30606.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: -13.05 m longitudinal and 5.51 m laterally indicates a distance but similar lateral motion as obstacle 30604.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinally moving away, thus no immediate threat.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30607.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: 15.70 m longitudinally and 27.99 m laterally is quite a safe distance.
  - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The longitudinal approach is minimal (-5.85 m/s) and manageable.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30610.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: 0.22 m longitudinally and 2.03 m laterally indicates extreme proximity.
  - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: With a longitudinal distance practically zero, there is an urgent threat.
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30611.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: 12.23 m longitudinal and 40.35 m laterally suggests distant safety.
  - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Approaching but manageable velocity ensures it won't cause problems soon.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30629.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Colliding as the real distance is 0.0 m both longitudinally and laterally indicates an unavoidable impact.
  - Distance safety score: 0 (Collision)
  - Time Risk reason: Immediate collision as the velocities forecast an impact scenario.
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 0
