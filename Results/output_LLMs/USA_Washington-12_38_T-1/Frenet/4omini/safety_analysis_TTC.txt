### Safety analysis for timestep 3.3: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30604
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance -11.65 m indicates the obstacle is behind the ego vehicle, while lateral distance of 9.01 m means it's toward the rear-left. Thus, the obstacle is moving away longitudinally and closing laterally, resulting in manageable but close proximity.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal relative velocity of -19.65 m/s indicates a quick approach longitudinally, although it's moving away. The lateral movement adds complexity but is manageable with attention.
  - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30605
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is at a longitudinal distance of 12.16 m and is closing in laterally with a distance of 17.69 m. It's a moderate distance but still a forward obstacle.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The longitudinal relative velocity of -5.85 m/s indicates it is approaching, but the rate is lower, keeping the collision risk moderate.
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30606
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance of -13.05 m puts the obstacle behind the ego vehicle, with a lateral distance of 5.51 m indicating it is moving toward the rear-left. The vehicle is moving away longitudinally but closing laterally.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The longitudinal velocity suggests quick closure potential but with lateral motion considered, would remain manageable if monitored closely.
  - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30607
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Indicates longitudinal distance of 15.7 m (safe distance) and lateral distance of 27.99 m (far left), suggesting low risk from this location.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** With a lower approach speed noted in longitudinal and lateral directions, the risk remains low for collision situations.
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30610
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance of 0.22 m indicates immediate proximity; lateral distance of 2.03 m means a very high risk of collision.
  - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Almost negligible time before potential collision based on both longitudinal and lateral velocities.
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30629
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle being longitudinally and laterally at 0.0 m indicates a direct collision.
  - **Distance safety score:** 0 (Collision)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The immediate alignment with the ego car makes collision certain with a relative velocity of -4.96 m/s.
  - **Time safety score:** 0 (Collision)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 0 (Collision)
