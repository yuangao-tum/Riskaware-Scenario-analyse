### Safety analysis for timestep 3.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**General Notes:**  TTC calculations can be unreliable when relative velocity is close to zero or when acceleration plays a significant role. In such cases, MDC and the descriptive motion information become more critical for risk assessment.  A negative TTClong value often indicates the obstacle is moving away longitudinally.

- **Obstacle ID: 30604.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located behind the ego vehicle (-11.65m longitudinal) and slightly to the left (9.01m lateral). Moving away longitudinally but towards the ego car laterally.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally (negative TTClong). Lateral velocity is small, moderate lateral distance.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30605.0**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Ahead and to the left (12.16m longitudinal, 17.69m lateral). Closing longitudinally, no lateral relative motion initially.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason:  TTClong indicates some time to react, but lateral acceleration needs monitoring.
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30606.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Behind and to the left, similar to 30604.0 but slightly further away longitudinally.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, slight lateral movement inwards.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30607.0**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Further ahead and to the left than 30605.0. Moving closer longitudinally but away laterally.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Ample time longitudinally, lateral motion is diverging.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30608.0**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Far ahead and slightly to the left. Closing longitudinally.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Ample time to react longitudinally.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 30609.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Similar longitudinal distance to 30605.0 but further left.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Similar TTClong to 30605.0 but with lateral motion inwards.  Requires attention.
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3


- **Obstacle ID: 30610.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Very close, almost directly in front and slightly to the left.
    - Distance safety score: 1
    - Time Risk reason:  Extremely low TTClong suggests imminent collision.
    - Time safety score: 1
    - Overall Risk score: 1


- **Obstacle ID: 30611.0**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Ahead and significantly to the left.  Closing longitudinally.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Moderate TTClong, lateral movement not immediately concerning.
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30612.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Far ahead and slightly to the left.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Ample time to react.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30613.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Directly beside the ego vehicle.
    - Distance safety score: 2
    - Time Risk reason:  Longitudinal alignment suggests potential for collision, lateral motion diverging. Requires immediate attention.
    - Time safety score: 2
    - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30614.0**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Close behind and slightly to the left. Moving away longitudinally.
    - Distance safety score: 3
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, lateral motion slightly diverging.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

-[... Similar analysis repeated for all remaining obstacles]

- **Obstacle ID: 30629.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: At collision point (0,0).
    - Distance safety score: 0
    - Time Risk reason:  Already colliding.
    - Time safety score: 0
    - Overall Risk score: 0
