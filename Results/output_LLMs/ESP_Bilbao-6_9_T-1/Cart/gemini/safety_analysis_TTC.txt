Safety analysis for the last timestep (13.5 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 13.5: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since the provided data lacks precise trajectory information and dimensions of the vehicles, we will make simplified assumptions for demonstration. We will primarily rely on Euclidean distance and relative velocity for a basic risk assessment. A more sophisticated analysis would involve predicting future trajectories, considering vehicle shapes, and using more complex collision detection algorithms.

We'll define a "danger zone" around the ego vehicle.  For this simplified analysis, we'll use a circular danger zone with a radius of 10 meters. If an obstacle is within this zone, and the relative velocity suggests they are getting closer, we will assign a higher risk score.


**Calculations and Reasoning:**

We need to calculate the distance between the ego vehicle and each obstacle.  We also need an estimate of the relative velocity.  Let's assume the worst-case scenario: vehicles are heading directly toward each other. Then the relative velocity is simply the sum of their speeds if they are moving towards each other, and the difference if moving away.

**Example Calculation (Obstacle 30683):**

* **Distance:** sqrt((177.1986 - 108.949)^2 + (546.0283 - 505.0833)^2) ≈ 73.6 meters
* **Relative Velocity:**  Assuming they are heading towards each other (we don't have enough information to determine this precisely), it would be 2.3089 + 9.619 ≈ 11.9 m/s.
* **Rough TTC:** 73.6 m / 11.9 m/s ≈ 6.2 seconds.

**Note:** This TTC is a rough estimate. It assumes constant velocity and a straight-line trajectory, which might not be accurate.
