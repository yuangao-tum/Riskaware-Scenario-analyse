Safety analysis for the last timestep (13.5 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 13.5: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30683.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is located in lanelet 136.0, which is not the same as the ego vehicle (134.0). A significant lateral and longitudinal distance exists.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Given its significant velocity difference and distant location, both lateral and longitudinal TTC are high, indicating negligible collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30684.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 96.0, far from ego's lanelet 134.0. Large longitudinal distance reduces collision risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The significant longitudinal distance correlates with high TTC, low collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30686.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Situated in lanelet 103.0, the obstacle is significantly displaced from ego's lanelet, reducing collision likelihood.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: With decent separation in location and lanes, both TTCs are high, indicating low risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30687.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle resides in lanelet 111.0, which poses no immediate collision risk due to substantial separation.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Safety is confirmed as both lateral and longitudinal TTC values are high owing to the considerable distance.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30688.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in lanelet 110.0 and stationary; however, the location is outside the ego's trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: As there's no movement and substantial lane separation, TTC indicates negligible risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30689.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 140.0, far from the ego's current path (lanelet 134.0).
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity, though nonzero, poses no threat owing to significant lane separation.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30690.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stopped in lanelet 116.0, with a substantial distance from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Given it's stationary and distant from ego's trajectory, TTC is very high.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30691.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Slightly moves in lanelet 110.0, without intersecting the ego's path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The motion is negligible and distance is sufficient to ensure safety.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30692.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: In lanelet 103.0; unlikely to impact due to lane and trajectory separation from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: High TTC values reflect negligible proximity risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30693.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in the same lanelet 134.0 but stationary and provides sufficient distance safety.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Despite shared lane, zero velocity and adequate TTC eliminate collision threat.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5
