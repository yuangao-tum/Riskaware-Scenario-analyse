Safety analysis for the last timestep (13.5 seconds):
### Safety Analysis for Timestep 13.5

### Obstacle Analysis:
We will analyze each obstacle according to the metrics Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):

#### 1. Obstacle ID: 30683.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The ego vehicle is in lanelet 134.0, and this obstacle is positioned in lanelet 136.0, which suggests they are in separate trajectories. Hence, the distance is acceptable.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Since the obstacle is moving away and is in a different lanelet, the TTC is expected to be high.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### 2. Obstacle ID: 30684.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned in lanelet 96.0, this obstacle is relatively far from the ego vehicle and not on a collision course.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Again, being in a different lanelet and moving consistently, the time to collision remains sufficient.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### 3. Obstacle ID: 30686.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Located in lanelet 103.0, moderately far, and not directly in the trajectory of the ego vehicle.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: With both vehicles traveling on different paths and considerable distance, the TTC is also sufficient, suggesting safety.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### 4. Obstacle ID: 30687.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The proximity is reasonable, and the lanelet is different.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Similar to previous analyses, the TTC suggests no immediate threat of collision.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### 5. Obstacle ID: 30688.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle is stationary and located in lanelet 110.0, which is not identical to the ego's trajectory but nearby.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: The TTC is indefinite as the obstacle is not moving, which adds major safety.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### 6. Obstacle ID: 30689.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle is in lanelet 140.0, far enough not to create immediate collision issues.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Again, this obstacle being quite far means there is a sufficient TTC.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### 7. Obstacle ID: 30690.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The ego vehicle is in lanelet 134.0, and this obstacle is far and stationary in lanelet 116.0.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: As a stationary object, the time to collision is effectively infinite.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### 8. Obstacle ID: 30691.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle is only slightly in front of the ego vehicle and moving at a very slow velocity.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: The TTC remains manageable due to the slow movement, yet there could be a slight closing speed.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### 9. Obstacle ID: 30692.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: It is in a different lanelet (lanelet 103.0), ensuring a safe distance.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: TTC remains high, making it a low risk.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### 10. Obstacle ID: 30693.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle is stationary and directly in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 2 (High Risk) - It is a potential collision risk if the ego vehicle continues, as the positions are quite close.
- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle is stationary, so collision is imminent if the ego continues. This earns a lower score on the TTC.
- **Time Safety Score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30693.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 1
    }
}
``` 

In conclusion, while most obstacles present a low risk due to sufficient distance and being in different lanelets, Obstacle 30693.0 shows an immediate threat due to its stationary position in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, presenting a scenario that could lead to a collision. Immediate action would be required to avoid collision in this case.
