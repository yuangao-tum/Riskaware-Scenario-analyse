Safety analysis for the last timestep (13.5 seconds):
I'll analyze the collision risk for this scenario:

1. First, let's identify critical obstacles:
- Ego vehicle is primarily in lanelet 132/134/1092
- Most relevant obstacles: 30683 (sharing path ahead), 30693 (stationary in lanelet 384)

2. Detailed Analysis:

For Obstacle 30683:
- Starting position ~10m ahead of ego
- Similar trajectory, moving in same direction
- Maintained safe following distance (~8-10m)
- Velocity difference manageable (9.6 m/s vs 4.0 m/s)
Distance Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk - Sufficient following distance)
Time Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk - Controlled speed differential)
Overall Risk Score: 4

For Obstacle 30693:
- Stationary object
- Different lanelet
- Large lateral separation
Distance Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk - Different path)
Time Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk - No convergence)
Overall Risk Score: 5

Other obstacles are in different lanelets with no immediate collision path.

3. Summary findings:
- No immediate collision risks identified
- Main interaction is with vehicle 30683 but maintains safe distance
- No emergency maneuvers required
- All other vehicles following expected trajectories

JSON Summary:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Key Observations:
1. The ego vehicle maintains controlled deceleration
2. Sufficient spacing between vehicles
3. No critical TTC values observed
4. All vehicles following expected paths
5. No emergency maneuvers or sudden trajectory changes detected

Overall, the scenario shows normal traffic flow with appropriate safety margins maintained between vehicles. No immediate collision risks or extreme hazards are present.
