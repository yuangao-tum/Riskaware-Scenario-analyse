To analyze the collision risks based on the provided data, we first need to calculate the Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) for each obstacle. The TTC is computed using the following formulas:

- **Longitudinal TTC**: \( \text{TTC}_{long} = \frac{\text{DTClong}}{V_{rel\_long}} \)
- **Lateral TTC**: \( \text{TTC}_{lat} = \frac{\text{DTClat}}{V_{rel\_lat}} \)

If \( V_{rel} \) (relative velocity) is zero or negative, the TTC is considered infinite (or non-applicable).

The Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) can be evaluated using the distance values \( DTClong \) and \( DTClat \):

- **MDC**: \( \text{MDC} = \sqrt{(\text{DTClong})^2 + (\text{DTClat})^2} \)

Additionally, we will analyze whether the distances and velocities indicate potential collision risks to assign risk scores accordingly.

Now, let's evaluate each obstacle:
