**- Obstacle ID: 30689.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 14.0m in front and 12.04m to the left, approaching longitudinally but moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally, TTClong = 14.0m / 4.12m/s ≈ 3.4s. Lateral movement away, no TTClat calculated.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30690.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 110.45m behind and 42.06m to the left, moving away in both directions (although no lateral relative motion specified, the distance is significant).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away, no TTC calculated, no time risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30691.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 89.55m behind and 9.33m to the left, moving away longitudinally, slightly approaching laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, no TTClong.  TTClat = 9.33m / 0.07m/s ≈ 133s, very large, no immediate lateral risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30692.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 22.3m behind and 57.85m to the right, slightly approaching longitudinally, moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: TTClong = 22.3m / 0.03m/s ≈ 743s, very large, no immediate risk. Moving away laterally, no TTClat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30693.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 0.02m in front and 0m laterally.  **Imminent collision**.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally, TTClong = 0.02m / 2.31m/s ≈ 0.009s.  Essentially zero, confirming imminent collision.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0
