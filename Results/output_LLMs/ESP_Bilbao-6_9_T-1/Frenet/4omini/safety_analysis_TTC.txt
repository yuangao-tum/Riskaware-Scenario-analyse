### Safety analysis for timestep 13.5: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30683.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance (75.03 m) and lateral distance (1.14 m) indicate it is far from the ego vehicle and moving away.  
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocity longitudinally (7.3 m/s) and laterally (0.33 m/s) show no imminent threat as it's moving away; however, it maintains some approach laterally.  
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30684.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance (-88.09 m) and lateral distance (-57.91 m) indicate significant separation, with the obstacle moving away.  
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason:** While the obstacle is moving away with a relative speed indicating no threat, the longitudinal motion towards the ego vehicle could be a concern.  
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30686.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal (-30.34 m) and lateral (-29.01 m) show a close rear situation but still a safe distance. Obstacles moving away indicate lower collision risk.  
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason:** A relative velocity longitudinally of (-0.5 m/s) and laterally (-6.49 m/s) shows a decreasing separation, manageable with time to react.  
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4  

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 30687.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance is negative (-81.98 m), indicating it is far; laterally it is closer (7.55 m) but still manageable.  
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason:** The significant relative velocity longitudinally (-9.16 m/s) indicates the obstacle is pulling away, and time to react is sufficient.  
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4  

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 30688.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Distances (-83.66 m, 4.52 m) suggest a safe distance with no lateral motion indicating stability.  
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason:** The longitudinal relative velocity of (-2.31 m/s) suggests no immediate collision concern and manageable time to react.  
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4  

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 30689.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason:** A longitudinal distance of 14.0 m poses a moderate concern as it is relatively close, even with a lateral 12.04 m.  
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle approaches longitudinally (-4.12 m/s), increasing risk, though lateral movement aids in safety.  
  - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3  

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 30690.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason:** A distance of (-110.45 m, 42.06 m) suggests significant distance with minimal immediate threat as it is further back.  
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is not moving towards the ego vehicle laterally, thus time to react is present.  
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4  

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 30691.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The distances (-89.55 m, 9.33 m) indicate distance behind although it is approaching the vehicle laterally, warranting attention.  
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason:** The lateral approach combined with longitudinal distance indicates likely needs to monitor; however, management is needed.  
  - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3  

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 30692.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal (-22.3 m) indicates close distance and lateral (-57.85 m) suggests it may not be concerning at present.  
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason:** Although the obstacle approaches from behind, the relative speed of only (0.03 m/s) suggests it is stable.  
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3  

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 30693.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Almost no distance towards the ego vehicle at (0.02 m), representing immediate collision risk.  
  - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason:** The longitudinal approach at (-2.31 m/s) without additional lateral movement compounds risk; immediate action is needed to avoid impact.  
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1
