- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 5  
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 5 (DSC = LongDSC * 0.5 + LatDSC * 0.5 = 5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)

- **Time Risk Reason:** Both Longitudinal and Lateral times are safe; hence, there’s negligible risk of collision.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 5  
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 5 (TSC = LongTSC * 0.5 + LatTSC * 0.5 = 5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)

- **Overall Risk Score:** 5

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 352
- **Relative Direction:** Front-right
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Longitudinal distance of 11.64 m indicates security, while lateral distance of 1.48 m poses a risk due to proximity.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 4

- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 3 (DSC = LongDSC * 0.5 + LatDSC * 0.5 = 4 * 0.5 + 2 * 0.5)

- **Time Risk Reason:** Both times being infinite indicates that there’s no immediate risk of collision.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 5  
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 5 (TSC = LongTSC * 0.5 + LatTSC * 0.5 = 5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)

- **Overall Risk Score:** 4

### Obstacle Analysis:
