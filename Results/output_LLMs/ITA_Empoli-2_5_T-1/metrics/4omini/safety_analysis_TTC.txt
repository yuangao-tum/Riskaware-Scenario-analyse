Safety analysis for timestep 2.6 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.6: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 38
- **Relative Direction:** Front
- **Distance Risk Reason:** The longitudinal distance is 54.39, indicating no risk of collision, while the lateral distance is 0.0, indicating a risk of collision directly to the side.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 0
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 2.5 (calculated as \(5*1 + 0*(1-1) = 5 + 0 = 5\); dominant direction is front)
- **Time Risk Reason:** The longitudinal time is infinite, indicating that the obstacle poses no risk longitudinally, but the lateral time is 0.0, which indicates an immediate collision risk.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 5
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 0
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 2.5 (calculated as \(5*1 + 0*(1-1) = 5 + 0 = 5\); dominant direction is front)
- **Overall Risk Score:** 3 (rounded down from 2.5)
