Safety analysis for timestep 2.6 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 38
  - Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is moving away longitudinally with DTClong > 5, indicating negligible risk.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5 
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Time Risk Reason: Infinite TTClong as the obstacle is moving away, indicating negligible risk.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 39
  - Distance Risk Reason: At DTClong = 3.42, it's in the medium risk range. DTClat = 1.37 places it in medium risk laterally.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 3 
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3 
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 3
  - Time Risk Reason: TTClong = 0.35, classifies it as an extreme risk. Infinite TTClat as it is moving away, indicating negligible lateral risk.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 3
  - Overall Risk Score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 320
  - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong = 19.43, which means low risk longitudinally. DTClat = 16.65, indicating negligible risk laterally as the obstacle is moving away.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5  
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Time Risk Reason: Infinite TTClong, negligible risk longitudinally. TTClat = 24.29, negligible lateral time risk.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 352
  - Distance Risk Reason: At DTClong = 11.64, it's in the low risk range. DTClat = 1.48 places it in medium risk laterally.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.5
  - Time Risk Reason: Both TTClong and TTClat are infinite, indicating negligible time risk.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Risk Score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 358
