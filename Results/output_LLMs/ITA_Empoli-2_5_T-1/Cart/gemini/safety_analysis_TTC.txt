Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.6 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories and dimensions of vehicles are not provided, we'll make some simplifying assumptions for this analysis. We'll treat vehicles as points and rely on position, velocity, and acceleration for TTC and MDC estimations.  We will consider a lane change imminent if an obstacle is in a different, but adjacent lanelet and its lateral distance to the ego vehicle is decreasing rapidly.

We'll use a simplified TTC calculation:  TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity. This is a basic estimation and more sophisticated methods would be used in a real autonomous driving system.  We will consider both longitudinal (along the ego vehicle's direction of travel) and lateral (perpendicular to the ego vehicle's direction of travel) components of TTC and MDC.

**### Obstacle Analysis:**

- **Obstacle ID: 38.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located significantly ahead and to the side of the ego vehicle in a different lanelet (1549 vs. 1552).  While the exact lanelet geometry isn't given, we assume these are parallel lanes.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is moving faster than the ego vehicle but the distance is relatively large.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 39.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is close to the ego vehicle and in a different, likely intersecting, lanelet (3198).  This indicates a potential crossing or merging scenario which warrants attention.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's high velocity and proximity combined with the ego vehicle's slow velocity and deceleration suggests a potentially high-risk scenario if the trajectories intersect.  
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 320.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Similar to obstacle 38, this obstacle is in a different, likely parallel lane (1416) and a safe distance away.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving much slower than other traffic and a safe distance away.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 352.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (3043), likely an intersecting/merging lane, and moderately close to the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's speed and proximity deserve attention but is less concerning than obstacle 39.0 due to slower velocity and larger distance.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 358.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet (1552) and behind the ego vehicle. 
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving faster than the ego vehicle, but from behind, so TTC isn't a primary concern, assuming it remains in the same lane.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 363.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is also in the same lanelet (1552) and further behind the ego vehicle than obstacle 358.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Similar to obstacle 358, this obstacle poses no immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
