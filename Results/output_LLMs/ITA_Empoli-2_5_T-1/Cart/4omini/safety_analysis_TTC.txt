Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.6 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.6: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Base Data:
- **Ego Vehicle Position:** (66.5327, 488.6289)
- **Ego Velocity:** 0.2582 m/s (decelerating at -0.2277 m/s²)
  
#### Identified Obstacles in Lanelet 1552.0 or Close Trajectory:
1. **Obstacle ID 358.0:** Position (64.702995, 482.97231), Velocity (4.9305365)
2. **Obstacle ID 363.0:** Position (60.505941, 469.97512), Velocity (4.5824051)

#### Calculations for Each Obstacle:

**1. Obstacle ID: 358.0**
- **Distance Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal distance to obstacle: 66.5327 - 64.702995 = 1.829705 (m)
  - Lateral distance to obstacle: 488.6289 - 482.97231 = 5.65659 (m)
  - MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision): √((1.829705)² + (5.65659)²) = 5.931 m

- **Time Calculation:**
  - Closing speed (Ego's speed + Obstacle's speed): 0.2582 + 4.9305365 = 5.1887365 m/s
  - TTC = MDC / Closing Speed = 5.931 / 5.1887365 = 1.142 seconds

**Risk Analysis:**
- **Distance Risk reason:** The potential minimum distance of 5.931 m indicates a manageable risk as they are in close proximity.
- **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk).
  
- **Time Risk reason:** With a TTC of 1.142 seconds, it shows moderate urgency as the Ego needs to react within a second to avoid a collision.
- **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk).

- **Overall Risk score:** (3 + 3) / 2 = 3 (Medium Risk)

**2. Obstacle ID: 363.0**
- **Distance Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal distance to obstacle: 66.5327 - 60.505941 = 6.026759 (m)
  - Lateral distance to obstacle: 488.6289 - 469.97512 = 18.65378 (m)
  - MDC: √((6.026759)² + (18.65378)²) = 19.864 m

- **Time Calculation:**
  - Closing speed (Ego + Obstacle speed): 0.2582 + 4.5824051 = 4.8406051 m/s
  - TTC = MDC / Closing Speed = 19.864 / 4.8406051 = 4.112 seconds

**Risk Analysis:**
- **Distance Risk reason:** The minimum distance of 19.864 m indicates minimal risk allowing time for safe maneuvering.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk).
  
- **Time Risk reason:** TTC of 4.112 seconds implies a significant buffer to react, indicating a low risk.
- **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk).

- **Overall Risk score:** (4 + 4) / 2 = 4 (Low Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
``` 

### Evaluation Summary:
No obstacles were identified with an Overall Risk Score of 0 or 1. There were two evaluated obstacles, both with medium and low risks. The situation suggests sufficient time and distance to react, supporting safe navigation away from collision risks.
