Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.6 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.6: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Assumptions and Preliminary Calculations:
- **Ego Vehicle**: 
  - Velocity: 0.2582 m/s
  - Acceleration: -0.2277 m/sÂ²
  - Position: (66.5327, 488.6289)
- Obstacles are evaluated based on proximity and velocity vectors relative to the ego vehicle. Calculations include potential future positions based on current velocity, orientation, and acceleration.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 38.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Far away in position and in a different lanelet. DTClong and DTClat values imply sufficient separation.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: High velocity and different lanelet direction make collision improbable.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 39.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned significantly north of the ego vehicle with high velocity away. Not aligned for potential collision.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: High TTClong due to velocity heading away from ego direction.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 320.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Situated in a distant lanelet; same is evident via calculating DTClong and DTClat.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Low relative velocity and different direction. Low TTClong and TTClat risk.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 352.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Moderate proximity; however, acceleration indicates no imminent collision course.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Direction and relative velocity contribute to low TTClong risk.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 358.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Close proximity in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle with slight speed difference is potentially concerning.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Medium risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: The proximity and aligned velocity vector may lead to a diminished TTClong.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 363.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: In the same lanelet as the ego vehicle with significant proximity; MDTClong often becomes concerning.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: The relative, aligned orientation and positive high acceleration can result in rapidly decreasing TTClong, suggesting a need for prompt intervention.
- **Time Safety Score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 2 (High Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

In this scenario, there are no collision obstacles nor extreme risk obstacles identified. However, obstacles 358.0 and 363.0 warrant attention due to medium and high risk levels, respectively.
