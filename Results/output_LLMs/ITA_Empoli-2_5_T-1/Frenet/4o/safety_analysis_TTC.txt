### Safety analysis for timestep 2.6: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 38.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is 54.39 m in front, with a lateral distance of 0.0 m. The obstacle is aligned longitudinally but is moving away.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle is moving away at 7.24 m/s, which increases the time to collision significantly. The relative acceleration shows a slight increase in velocity away from the ego vehicle.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 39.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle is quite close at 3.42 m front-left, with a lateral distance of 1.37 m. Its trajectory suggests it could cross into the ego's lane.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle is approaching longitudinally at -9.65 m/s, suggesting decreasing TTC. This is critical, as it is moving towards the ego vehicle and crossing its path.
- **Time Safety Score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 1

#### Obstacle ID: 320.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is at 19.43 m front-right, with lateral distance of -16.65 m, indicating it's mostly in the adjacent lane but has potential to move into the ego's path.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: With a small relative velocity (0.2 m/s) and some lateral movement (0.69 m/s), TTC is not critical, but requires monitoring.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 352.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: At 11.64 m front-right and lateral -1.48 m, the obstacle is ahead in an adjacent lane but moving away laterally, reducing immediate risk.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Given its velocity (2.23 m/s) and away movement (lateral -1.71 m/s), the obstacle is distancing itself over time.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 358.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: At -1.44 m behind directly, this obstacle is very close and aligned but approaching moderately.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: With a relative speed of 4.67 m/s approaching, the TTC is very low, indicating urgency.
- **Time Safety Score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 1

#### Obstacle ID: 363.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned -15.1 m behind, it follows in the same lane, suggesting it may close the gap over time.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Despite being behind and approaching at 4.32 m/s, the distance allows more reaction time compared to Obstacle 358.0.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3
