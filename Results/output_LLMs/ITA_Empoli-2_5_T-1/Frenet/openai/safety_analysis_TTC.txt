### Safety analysis for timestep 2.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID**: 38.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 54.39 m, which is quite significant, while the lateral distance is 0.0 m. The obstacle is moving away longitudinally, reducing collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's relative velocity is 7.24 m/s longitudinally (moving away). Thus, the TTC = Distance / Velocity = 54.39 m / 7.24 m/s = 7.51s. This indicates there is sufficient time to react.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID**: 39.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance of 3.42 m is extremely close, while the lateral separation of 1.37 m is inadequate considering the obstacle is driving toward the ego vehicle in the front-left.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative longitudinal velocity is -9.65 m/s (obstacle approaching). TTC = 3.42 m / 9.65 m/s = 0.35s, indicating an imminent collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 1
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1

- **Obstacle ID**: 320.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: With a longitudinal distance of 19.43 m and lateral distance of -16.65 m, this obstacle is moving away longitudinally but approaching laterally from the right.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: The longitudinal relative velocity is 0.2 m/s, meaning the TTC = 19.43 m / 0.2 m/s = 97.15s. Although the alignment raises some moderate concern, the long TTC suggests manageable risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 

- **Obstacle ID**: 352.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance of 11.64 m and lateral distance of -1.48 m indicates some concern, although the obstacle is moving away gradually in both dimensions.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle has a relative velocity of 2.23 m/s longitudinally. TTC = 11.64 m / 2.23 m/s = 5.22s provides reasonable time to avoid collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID**: 358.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance of -1.44 m indicates that the obstacle is directly behind (approaching) the ego vehicle with a lateral distance of 0.0 m.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1
  - **Time Risk reason**: With a longitudinal velocity of 4.67 m/s approaching, TTC = 1.44 m / 4.67 m/s = 0.31s indicates immediate collision risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 1
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1

- **Obstacle ID**: 363.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance of -15.1 m shows this obstacle is also approaching directly from behind. The lateral distance being 0.0 m adds to the immediate concern.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1
  - **Time Risk reason**: With a relative velocity of 4.32 m/s, TTC = 15.1 m / 4.32 m/s = 3.49s indicates that while there is some time, itâ€™s still very close.
  - **Time safety score**: 2
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1

### Summary in JSON Format: 
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "39.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "358.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

### Findings:
- **Obstacle 39.0** is at immediate collision risk with very little time to react.
- **Obstacles 358.0 and 363.0** also pose an extreme risk, with the ego vehicle being approached from behind.
- Other obstacles largely have manageable risks with sufficient time to react.
