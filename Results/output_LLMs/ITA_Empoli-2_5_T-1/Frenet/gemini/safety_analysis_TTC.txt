### Safety analysis for timestep 2.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 38.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far away longitudinally (54.39m) and laterally aligned (0.0m) in front of the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally (7.24 m/s).
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 39.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is very close longitudinally (3.42m) and laterally (1.37m) in front-left of the ego vehicle.
