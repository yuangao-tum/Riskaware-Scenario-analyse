### Safety analysis for timestep: 2.6 seconds: Here’s the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 38.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 54.39 m away longitudinally and 0.0 m laterally, indicating a significantly safe distance.
  - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk).
  - Time Risk reason: With a longitudinal relative velocity of 7.24 m/s and moving away, the Time to Collision (TTC) is very high (TTC = 54.39 m / 7.24 m/s ≈ 7.51 seconds).
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk).
  - Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

- **Obstacle ID: 39.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 3.42 m away longitudinally and 1.37 m laterally, which is dangerously close and indicates a possible collision path.
  - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk).
  - Time Risk reason: With a longitudinal relative velocity of -9.65 m/s, TTC is calculated as 3.42 m / 9.65 m/s ≈ 0.36 seconds, indicating almost immediate collision.
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk).
  - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk).

- **Obstacle ID: 320.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: It is 19.43 m away longitudinally and -16.65 m laterally. The negative lateral distance suggests proximity but is manageable.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk).
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal relative velocity of 0.2 m/s gives a TTC of 19.43 m / 0.2 m/s = 97.15 seconds. The obstacle is moving away but poses some lateral threat.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk).
  - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk).

- **Obstacle ID: 352.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Positioned at 11.64 m longitudinally and -1.48 m laterally; it’s relatively close.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk).
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal velocity is 2.23 m/s, leading to a TTC of 11.64 m / 2.23 m/s ≈ 5.22 seconds, manageable but needs attention.
  - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk).
  - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).

- **Obstacle ID: 358.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Estimated distance is -1.44 m longitudinally (indicating it is behind the ego car and getting closer).
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk).
  - Time Risk reason: At a velocity of 4.67 m/s, the TTC is -1.44 m / 4.67 m/s = -0.31 seconds, suggesting an immediate risk of collision.
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk).
  - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk).

- **Obstacle ID: 363.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Located -15.1 m behind the ego car, indicating it too is approaching.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk).
  - Time Risk reason: Relative velocity of 4.32 m/s leads to TTC of -15.1 m / 4.32 m/s = -3.49 seconds, indicating an imminent collision.
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk).
  - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk).

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "39.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

### Conclusion:
- There is one obstacle (39.0) demonstrating extreme risk with an immediate likelihood of collision. Other obstacles are at varying risk levels, but none present a collision risk (0).
