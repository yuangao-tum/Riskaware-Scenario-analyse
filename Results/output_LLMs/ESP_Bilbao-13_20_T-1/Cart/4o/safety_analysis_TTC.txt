Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.2 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.2: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
#### Obstacle ID: 30795.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is in the same lanelet (367.0) but located behind the ego vehicle with significant lateral separation. The lateral distance is not minimal.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving faster towards the ego vehicle but the velocity is relatively low. TTC indicates manageable risk.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30798.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is on a different lanelet and significantly far laterally.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: With much higher speed and on a different path, no immediate collision path.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30799.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is close in the adjacent lanelet (367.0) but still not within a dangerous proximity due to the relative position.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: The low velocity and current trajectory indicate minimal immediate risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30800.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary obstacle in the same lanelet area but laterally distant.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Non-moving obstacle, negligible time risk as no relative speed difference.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30801.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is in the same primary lanelet as ego vehicle (705.0) but slightly turned and lateral distance allows maneuverability.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative speed and trajectory suggest moderate risk; possible for collisions to be managed timely.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30802.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is stationary, located laterally away in a different lanelet.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Zero velocity;
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30803.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in a different lanelet (367.0), but with velocity.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: With relatively high speed, away enough not to pose an immediate threat.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30804.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in lanelet 1513.0 which is not in the immediate trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: High speed, but trajectory still does not pose immediate collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30805.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is located in the same lane (705.0) as the ego vehicle but is moving along its direction.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Higher speed indicates clearance and trajectory control with low risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30806.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Similar lane trajectory, yet moving speedily away from ego trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Relative speed and acceleration show decreased collision manauevability.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30807.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: In a facing lanelet and away laterally, not a direct collision threat.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Medium speed signals, not a direct threat, and manageable return path.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30809.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in lanelet 367.0 with moderate proximity but in distant alignment.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Allied direction along its travel, with a slowing speed.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30810.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Not part of current trajectory in facing side with sufficient lateral space.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Aligned path lesser possibility of direct path collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5
