Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.2 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.2s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories and dimensions of vehicles are not provided, I'm making simplified assumptions for illustrative purposes.  I'll primarily use Euclidean distance for MDC and a basic constant velocity model for TTC.  A more robust analysis would involve predicting future trajectories, considering vehicle shapes, and incorporating uncertainties.

**Calculations and Reasoning:**

To determine risk, I'm considering both the distance and TTC.  A shorter distance or lower TTC increases the risk.  I'm assuming a threshold for "extreme risk" (score 1) if TTC < 1s or MDC < 2m (these are examples and should be tuned based on the specific application). "High risk" (score 2) might be TTC < 2s or MDC < 5m, and so on.  The relative direction and lanelet information are crucial for a real-world scenario but are simplified here due to the lack of detailed trajectory information.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**Note:**  Detailed calculations of TTC and MDC for each obstacle would require more information. I am providing a qualitative assessment based on the limited data.
