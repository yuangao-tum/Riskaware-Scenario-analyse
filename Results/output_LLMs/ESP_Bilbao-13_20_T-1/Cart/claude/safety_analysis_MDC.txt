Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.2 seconds):
I'll analyze the collision risks for the ego vehicle based on the provided scenario.

### Safety Analysis:

1. **Identifying Critical Obstacles:**
- Ego vehicle is in lanelet 705.0
- Key obstacles in the same or adjacent lanelets:
  * Obstacle 30801 (same lanelet 705)
  * Obstacle 30805 (same lanelet 705)
  * Obstacle 30807 (same lanelet 705)
  * Obstacle 30810 (same lanelet 705)
  * Obstacle 30804 (adjacent lanelet 706)
  * Obstacle 30806 (adjacent lanelet 706)

2. **Detailed Analysis:**

For Obstacle 30801:
- Distance Risk: Small longitudinal separation (~4m), same lanelet
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk: Low relative velocity, increasing separation
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3

For Obstacle 30805:
- Distance Risk: Moderate longitudinal separation (~12m), same lanelet
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk: Similar velocity, stable separation
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4

For Obstacle 30807:
- Distance Risk: Larger longitudinal separation (~20m), same lanelet
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk: Higher velocity but maintaining separation
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4

For Obstacle 30810:
- Distance Risk: Good separation, same lanelet
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk: Stable separation maintained
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Key Findings:
1. No immediate collision risks detected (no score of 0 or 1)
2. Closest vehicle (30801) presents moderate risk but maintains safe separation
3. All other vehicles in the same lanelet maintain safe distances and velocities
4. Adjacent lanelet vehicles pose no significant risk due to lateral separation

Recommendations:
1. Monitor obstacle 30801 as it's the closest vehicle
2. Maintain current velocity and trajectory as current situation is stable
3. No immediate evasive actions required
