## Safety analysis for timestep 2.2: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Calculations:
- **Time to Collision (TTC)**: Calculated as \( \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Velocity}} \) in both longitudinal and lateral directions. Note that if relative velocity is approaching \(< 0\), TTC is meaningful; if \(> 0\), it's moving away.
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**: Consider the smallest distance using the magnitude of the longitudinal and lateral distances.
