### Safety analysis for timestep 2.2 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 30795.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance (18.03 m) is relatively safe, but the lateral distance (-35.41 m) suggests that the obstacle is in a close path and moving toward the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Using the relative velocities, we calculate:
    - Longitudinal TTC = DTClong / -Vrel_long = 18.03 / 0.95 ≈ 19.0 seconds.
    - Lateral TTC = DTClat / Vrel_lat = -35.41 / 2.02 ≈ -17.54 seconds (negative indicates moving toward).
  - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30798.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance (34.78 m) is ample and the lateral distance (-2.13 m) suggests it is very close, but moving away.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: 
    - Longitudinal TTC = 34.78 / -13.22 ≈ -2.63 seconds (negative, moving away).
    - Lateral TTC = -2.13 / 0.18 ≈ -11.83 seconds (also negative).
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30799.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance (14.77 m) is moderate; lateral distance (-25.86 m) indicates a strong approach from the right.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Time Risk reason:
    - Longitudinal TTC = 14.77 / 0.45 ≈ 32.83 seconds.
    - Lateral TTC = -25.86 / 0.55 ≈ -47.04 seconds (indicates an approaching risk).
  - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30800.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: With a longitudinal distance of 12.16 m and a lateral distance of -18.22 m, this is a significant risk, indicating a potential impact.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Time Risk reason:
    - Longitudinal TTC = 12.16 / 0.27 ≈ 45.04 seconds.
    - Lateral TTC = -18.22 / 0.02 ≈ -911.00 seconds (shows approaching).
  - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30801.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance (-0.19 m) indicates immediate risk from behind.
  - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: 
    - Longitudinal TTC is essentially immediate (close to collision).
    - Lateral TTC is irrelevant as the obstacle is directly behind.
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30802.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: A longitudinal distance of 9.73 m combined with -11.10 lateral indicates a close approach.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Time Risk reason:
    - Longitudinal TTC = 9.73 / 0.26 ≈ 37.40 seconds.
    - Lateral TTC = -11.10 / 0.0 = ∞ if stationary, otherwise indicates moving toward.
  - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30803.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance (27.63 m) looks safe; lateral distance (-63.54 m) suggests it is farther away.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason:
    - Longitudinal TTC = 27.63 / 2.5 ≈ 11.05 seconds.
    - Lateral TTC = -63.54 / 6.57 ≈ -9.66 seconds (indicates upcoming).
  - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30804.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance (3.2 m) is alarming as it is borderline immediate impact.
  - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Lateral moving away means immediate severance.
  - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30805.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: From behind (-11.38 m), immediate risk is similar to other rear obstacles.
  - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Immediate potential collision.
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30806.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: A distance of -3.18 m from the back indicates imminent contact.
  - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC indicates nearly immediate.
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30807.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinally -23.88 m indicates a rapid change.
  - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Immediate approaching.
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30809.0**
