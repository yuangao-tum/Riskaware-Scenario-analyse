### Safety analysis for timestep 2.2s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30795.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Moderately far, but moving closer laterally and longitudinally.  Front-right location necessitates careful monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  TTC calculations are complex due to lateral movement.  The closing longitudinal velocity suggests moderate risk if the lateral movement brings it into the ego vehicle's path.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30798.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far away and moving further from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally poses no immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30799.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close, and closing longitudinally and laterally. Its front-right position warrants attention.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Similar to 30795, the closing velocity and lateral movement require careful monitoring although TTC is not immediately alarming.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30800.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Quite close, and slightly closing longitudinally.  Lateral movement is minimal. Front-right position.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Slow closing speed and proximity raise concern. Lateral movement minimal.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 30801.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close longitudinally, practically behind the ego vehicle.  
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: While moving away longitudinally, the extreme proximity represents a high risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 30802.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Very close and slowly closing longitudinally. Front-right position and no lateral movement.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Proximity and closing speed, even if slow, necessitates prompt action.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 30803.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Far longitudinally but significant lateral closing speed from the front-right.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Lateral movement is the primary concern here. Requires monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


**- Obstacle ID: 30804.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close, almost colliding. Front-right position.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Although longitudinally moving away, the extreme proximity is highly dangerous.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 30805.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately far behind, but closing.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Closing from behind, needs monitoring.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30806.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Very close and closing from behind and the right.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Closing from behind, needs prompt reaction.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 30807.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far behind but closing.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Closing from behind needs monitoring.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30809.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately far, approaching longitudinally and laterally from the front-right.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Needs monitoring due to the closing movement.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30810.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Far behind and approaching.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Needs monitoring.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
