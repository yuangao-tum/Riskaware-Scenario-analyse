### Safety analysis for timestep 2.2: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30795
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal 18.03 m indicates the obstacle is relatively far, but lateral -35.41 m means it is significantly to the right. The real distance suggests a potential for collision with careful maneuvering required.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium)
  - **Time Risk reason**: With a relative velocity of longitudinal -0.95 m/s and lateral 2.02 m/s, the time to collision would be moderate. Calculating TTC: Longitudinal TTC = 18.03 / 0.95 = 18.95s, Lateral TTC = 35.41 / 2.02 = 17.53s. The maximum TTC is significantly higher than 2s, suggesting that collision is unlikely with a response time.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30798
  - **Distance Risk reason**: 34.78 m longitudinally indicates a safe distance ahead and -2.13 m laterally shows it’s heading away from the ego vehicle, indicating no collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Since the obstacle is moving away and the longitudinal velocity is positive (13.22 m/s), there is no risk of collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30799
  - **Distance Risk reason**: With longitudinal 14.77 m and lateral -25.86 m, it is fairly close with significant lateral offset, indicating potential risk but manageable.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal velocity -0.45 m/s combined with lateral 0.55 m/s makes it approach. Longitudinal TTC = 14.77 / 0.45 = 32.84s, Lateral TTC = 25.86 / 0.55 = 47.02s. Maximum TTC shows manageable risk of collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30800
  - **Distance Risk reason**: 12.16 m longitudinally and -18.22 m laterally puts it quite close to the ego vehicle, presenting a risk of collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High)
  - **Time Risk reason**: With a slow approach speed longitudinally (-0.27 m/s) and negligible lateral speed, TTC = 12.16 / 0.27 = 45.04s suggests a high collision risk but with time to react.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30801
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance -0.19 m indicates an immediate risk from behind. Distance is critical here.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme)
  - **Time Risk reason**: With a relative velocity of 3.27 m/s, collision is imminent due to a very short distance.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30802
  - **Distance Risk reason**: 9.73 m longitudinally and -11.1 m laterally are still in a range that suggests quick responses are crucial.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High)
  - **Time Risk reason**: With velocities that aren’t rapid and TTC being relatively safe, it presents a medium to high risk scenario.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30803
  - **Distance Risk reason**: 27.63 m and -63.54 m shows it is farther away but potentially in line of sight for collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Given the relatively low approach speed, TTC values indicate it is unlikely to collide in the immediate future.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30804
  - **Distance Risk reason**: 3.2 m longitudinally and -1.96 m make it very close and indicates a real risk of collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme)
  - **Time Risk reason**: With a rapid approach of 9.62 m/s longitudinally, collision is imminent (no substantial TTC).
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30805
  - **Distance Risk reason**: From behind with -11.38 m shows an immediate and high risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme)
  - **Time Risk reason**: 3.29 m/s indicates a very close approaching situation.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30806
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Immediate proximity at -3.18 m longitudinally and -2.51 m laterally denotes a critical situation.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocities indicate rapid approach. Collision is imminent.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30807
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Rear proximity at -23.88 m locationally with the potential for unsafe interactions.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Similar velocities indicate a potential late response may be necessary.
  - **Time safety score**: 2 (High)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30809
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinally 21.5 m and laterally -45.57 m positions it in a safe range, but potential for intersection exists.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The speed differential makes immediate collision unlikely with movement.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30810
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Rearward at -35.56 m is clearly out of the immediate collision range.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The movement indicates potential future interaction but not immediate collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible)
