### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30267.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Very close distance in the same longitudinal lane (0.8 m) and aligned laterally. High likelihood of immediate collision if no action is taken.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1
  - **Time Risk reason**: Very low relative velocity (-0.02 m/s) and relative acceleration (-0.01 m/sÂ²) suggest collision is imminent without intervention. TTC is close to zero.
  - **Time safety score**: 1
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30270.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Safe distance longitudinally (20.75 m) and significant lateral separation (13.36 m) provide time to respond to relative motion.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Negative relative velocity in both directions, but the distance allows for sufficient reaction time. TTC is moderate.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30271.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Far distance (42.39 m longitudinally) with lateral buffer (19.94 m), offering ample space to maneuver.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Despite higher relative speed (-13.28 m/s), sufficient distance prevents immediate risk. TTC is longer, allowing response time.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30272.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Close proximity longitudinally (12.57 m) with moderate lateral separation (-11.42 m) could increase risk if speed changes.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2
  - **Time Risk reason**: Very low relative velocity (-0.02 m/s) and acceleration suggest low time pressure for collision likelihood.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30273.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Large longitudinal distance (63.0 m) and lateral space (18.58 m), indicating no immediate collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Despite negative relative speed, large distances result in high TTC, indicating negligible collision risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30274.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Very close from behind (-0.19 m) and aligned laterally, indicating a very high immediate risk of rear collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1
  - **Time Risk reason**: Positive relative velocity (2.15 m/s), suggesting potential for a near-immediate collision without rapid action. TTC is minimal from behind.
  - **Time safety score**: 1
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30275.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Moderate separation longitudinally (15.99 m) and good lateral separation (-11.8 m), providing time to react.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Minimal relative movement (-0.02 m/s), negligible immediate collision risk. TTC is adequate.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30276.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Safe longitudinal distance (13.89 m) with significant lateral separation (-19.06 m), reducing immediate collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity (0.0 m/s) indicates stasis, while lateral motion is present but manageable within the given distances.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30277.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Adequate longitudinal space (10.24 m) and extensive lateral clearance (-19.05 m), indicating capable reaction space.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Positive relative velocity (0.15 m/s) suggests the obstacle is moving away, offering more time to avoid collision. TTC is substantial.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

The analysis of the given scenario reflects high immediate risks for obstacles 30267.0 and 30274.0 due to their positions and velocities relative to the ego vehicle. Proactive evasive actions are necessary to mitigate the potential for collisions with these obstacles. Other obstacles are manageable with timely driver or system responses, and some show minimal risks due to sufficient separation and controlled motion.
