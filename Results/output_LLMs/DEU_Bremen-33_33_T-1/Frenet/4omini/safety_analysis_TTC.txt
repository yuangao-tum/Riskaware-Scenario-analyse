### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID**: 30267.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance (0.8 m) is extremely close, indicating a significant risk of collision since it is within 1 meter.
   - **Distance safety score**: 1
   - **Time Risk reason**: With a relative velocity of -0.02 m/s, collision is imminent since the distance to the obstacle is so small.
   - **Time safety score**: 1
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1

2. **Obstacle ID**: 30270.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance (20.75 m) is safe, but the lateral distance (13.36 m) indicates that the obstacle is moving dangerously close, especially with a significant negative velocity.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2
   - **Time Risk reason**: With a longitudinal velocity of -1.76 m/s, it's approaching quickly, leading to a concern about potential cross paths (critical longitudinal speed).
   - **Time safety score**: 2
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2

3. **Obstacle ID**: 30271.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal (42.39 m) and lateral distances (19.94 m) suggest a relatively safe position.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity (longitudinal -13.28 m/s) indicates a very high speed towards the ego vehicle, which raises a potential collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 2
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2

4. **Obstacle ID**: 30272.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance (12.57 m) is safe, but itâ€™s in the front-right which is relevant for potential lateral interactions.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Lateral relative motion is minimal, indicating time to react.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

5. **Obstacle ID**: 30273.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance (63.0 m) and lateral (18.58 m) are safe distances. 
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: As the obstacle is approaching but still far away, time is sufficient to react.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

6. **Obstacle ID**: 30274.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance (-0.19 m) is unsafe as it indicates an overlap where the ego car is essentially colliding with the obstacle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 1
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity (2.15 m/s) suggests moving potentially into the obstacle, reinforcing the collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 1
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1

7. **Obstacle ID**: 30275.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance (15.99 m) means there is a safe buffer; however, the lateral distance is concerning.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: There is enough distance and time to adjust to the 0.02 m/s change.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

8. **Obstacle ID**: 30276.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance (13.89 m) is adequate for safety, but it is moving closer laterally.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative motion indicates not much risk for collision.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

9. **Obstacle ID**: 30277.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance (10.24 m) is within a safe range while the lateral distance indicates movement closer.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away slowly, further indicating a non-collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4
