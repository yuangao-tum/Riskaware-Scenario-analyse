### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30267.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close longitudinally (0.8m) in front of the ego vehicle.  
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally (-0.02 m/s), imminent collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30270.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively safe distance (20.75m longitudinal, 13.36m lateral) in front-left.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally (-1.76 m/s) and laterally (-0.28 m/s), but with sufficient time to react.  TTClong = 20.75m / 1.76 m/s ≈ 11.8s.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30271.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Safe distance (42.39m longitudinal, 19.94m lateral) in front-left.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally (-13.28 m/s), but decelerating (1.29 m/s²). Also closing laterally (-0.4 m/s). TTClong = 42.39m / 13.28m/s ≈ 3.2s. Deceleration suggests the risk might be mitigated soon.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30272.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close (12.57m longitudinal, -11.42m lateral) in front-right.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Almost stationary longitudinally (-0.02 m/s) and no lateral movement.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 30273.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Safe distance (63.0m longitudinal, 18.58m lateral) in front-left.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally (-10.42 m/s), but decelerating (1.77 m/s²).  TTClong = 63m / 10.42m/s ≈ 6s. Also closing laterally slightly.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30274.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close longitudinally (-0.19m) behind the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally (2.15 m/s), so collision is unlikely.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3


- **Obstacle ID: 30275.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close (15.99m longitudinal, -11.8m lateral) front-right.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Almost stationary longitudinally and no lateral movement.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30276.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close (13.89m longitudinal, -19.06m lateral) in front-right.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Stationary longitudinally and slow lateral movement towards ego vehicle (0.07 m/s).
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30277.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close (10.24m longitudinal, -19.05m lateral) in front-right.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally (0.15 m/s) and slowly closing laterally (0.47 m/s).  
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
