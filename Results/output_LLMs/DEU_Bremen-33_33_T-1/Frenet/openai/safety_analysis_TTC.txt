### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 30267.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is extremely close (0.8 m), indicating an immediate risk of collision from the front. 
  - Distance safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Given the longitudinal relative velocity of -0.02 m/s, the TTC = 0.8 m / 0.02 m/s = 40 seconds, indicating a long time before a possible collision, but due to the proximity, quick maneuvering is needed.
  - Time safety score: **3** (Medium Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **2** (High Risk - due to extreme proximity and significant risk of collision)

- **Obstacle ID: 30270.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 20.75 m, which is relatively safe, but lateral distance at 13.36 m presents a moderate risk as the obstacle is approaching from the left.
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The longitudinal relative velocity is -1.76 m/s, resulting in a TTC = 20.75 m / 1.76 m/s = 11.78 seconds, which indicates sufficient time, albeit it’s approaching fast laterally too.
  - Time safety score: **3** (Medium Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **3** (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30271.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 42.39 m, which is safe, and the lateral distance (19.94 m) reduces immediate concern but highlights potential lateral movement.
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC = 42.39 m / 13.28 m/s = 3.19 seconds is concerning due to high relative velocity indicating a faster impending collision.
  - Time safety score: **2** (High Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **3** (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30272.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 12.57 m. While this distance seems manageable, it presents a moderate risk as it’s only 11.42 m laterally.
  - Distance safety score: **3** (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC = 12.57 m / 0.02 m/s = 628.5 seconds which indicates a long time left but only if travelling at the same speed.
  - Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **3** (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30273.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 63.0 m and lateral distance 18.58 m; thus, the distance is safe and poses a minimum risk at this moment.
  - Distance safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC = 63.0 m / 10.42 m/s = 6.04 seconds indicates ample time before the risk increases. 
  - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **5** (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30274.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance is very close at -0.19 m, indicating that it is almost at the ego vehicle’s rear.
  - Distance safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity (2.15 m/s) indicating a TTC at the rear of 0.19 / 2.15 = 0.088 seconds, implying immediate collision.
  - Time safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **1** (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30275.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 15.99 m, which is reasonably safe combined with lateral distance -11.8 m.
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC = 15.99 m / 0.02 m/s = 799.5 seconds, indicating ample time and minimal concern.
  - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **4** (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30276.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance is 13.89 m, and it is moving away laterally, posing no immediate threat.
  - Distance safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Since the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, the TTC will not be a concern at this time.
  - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **5** (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30277.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance is 10.24 m, which raises some concerns due to proximity, while lateral distance is -19.05 m, posing a risk.
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The TTC presents a value of 10.24 / 0.15 = 68.27 seconds, indicating not much immediate concern.
  - Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **4** (Low Risk)
