Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories and shapes of vehicles are absent, I'm making simplified assumptions for this analysis. I'll primarily use Euclidean distance for MDC approximations and basic relative velocity for TTC estimations.  A more rigorous analysis would necessitate detailed trajectory predictions, vehicle dimensions, and sophisticated collision detection algorithms.  I'm also assuming a simplified 2D world.  Lanelet information is used to assess potential interaction but a deeper understanding of lanelet connectivity and intended maneuvers would be required for a truly accurate assessment.

**Ego Vehicle State:**
- Position: (243.7817, -473.6414)
- Velocity: 0.0225 (assumed units: m/s)
- Acceleration: -0.0122 (assumed units: m/s^2)
- Lanelet: 1727.0

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30267.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located near the ego vehicle laterally and slightly behind longitudinally.  The proximity raises concern.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Stationary and ego vehicle is moving slowly. Low immediate risk but requires monitoring.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30269.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Ego vehicle itself.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Not applicable
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30270.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located significantly behind and to the side of the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving slower than other vehicles in its general vicinity.  Less concerning than faster traffic.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30271.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located further behind than some other traffic, but its high speed poses a higher risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  High speed means it could close the distance rapidly. Requires attention.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30272.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located to the side and slightly ahead of the ego, but a different lanelet suggests a lower immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Stationary, thus not an immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30273.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Traveling at high speed and potentially approaching from behind diagonally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  High speed warrants close monitoring due to potential for rapidly decreasing distance.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30274.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in the same lanelet and very close behind the ego vehicle. Poses a significant risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Moving slightly faster than ego, but the proximity is the primary concern.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30275.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Similar to 30272.0: side and slightly ahead, different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Stationary, not an immediate time-related concern.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30276.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Further away laterally and longitudinally than many other vehicles.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Slow speed reduces the time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 30277.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Similar positioning and lanelet context to 30276.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Slightly faster than 30276, still relatively low risk due to distance.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
