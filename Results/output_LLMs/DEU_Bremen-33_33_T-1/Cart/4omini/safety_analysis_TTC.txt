Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30267.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle has a position of (238.8112, -471.7674) and is stationary. The ego vehicle's position is (243.7817, -473.6414), making the minimum distance to the obstacle approximately 5.3 meters.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk). The distance is manageable and allows for some reaction time.
   - **Time Risk reason**: Since the obstacle is stationary and the ego vehicle is moving at a very slow pace, the relative closing speed is minimal with no significant risk of collision.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk).
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk).

2. **Obstacle ID: 30270.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving towards a different lane, with a position of (214.8792, -478.7908). It is farther away than other nearby obstacles.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk). It is distant enough to not interfere with the ego vehicle.
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving, but it is significantly away from the path of the ego vehicle and poses no immediate collision threat.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk).
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk).

3. **Obstacle ID: 30271.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is on a potential collision path at a speed of 13.2589. Given its position, it has a closer relative distance to the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk). It needs attention due to its speed and proximity.
   - **Time Risk reason**: The velocity suggests a higher potential collision risk if the ego vehicle does not navigate properly.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk).
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk).

4. **Obstacle ID: 30272.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: It is stationary and positioned at (232.3654, -455.4477), not obstructing the path of the ego vehicle significantly.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk). There is enough space between the vehicles.
   - **Time Risk reason**: With no speed, there’s no urgency to respond to this particular obstacle.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk).
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk).

5. **Obstacle ID: 30273.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: At a distance of approximately 60 meters and travelling at a high speed (10.4219), this obstacle presents a moderate risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk). A potential path conflict exists.
   - **Time Risk reason**: Due to the speed, there's a chance for a collision in the near future barring evasive action.
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk).
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk).

6. **Obstacle ID: 30274.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving fairly slowly at a velocity of 2.1708, and not creating a significant threat to the ego vehicle’s path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk).
   - **Time Risk reason**: While the obstacle is in movement, it is manageable and moves parallel to the ego vehicle’s direction.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk).
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk).

7. **Obstacle ID: 30275.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: It's stationary, away from the ego vehicle, reducing any conflict chances.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk).
   - **Time Risk reason**: No movement and thus, no risk of collision.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk).
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk).

8. **Obstacle ID: 30276.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Also stationary, distant from the ego vehicle, ensuring minimal conflict.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk).
   - **Time Risk reason**: Such stationary status leads to no risk of collision.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk).
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk).

9. **Obstacle ID: 30277.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Some movement but at a lower velocity, providing a significant enough distance to not pose collision risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk).
   - **Time Risk reason**: Again, a slower speed and slight movement manage collision chances.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk).
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk).

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
``` 

### Conclusion:
- No immediate collision risks are identified in the analyzed timeline as all obstacles have a Risk Score of 0 or 1. However, Obstacle ID 30271.0 and Obstacle ID 30273.0 have been identified as carrying risk and should be monitored closely.
