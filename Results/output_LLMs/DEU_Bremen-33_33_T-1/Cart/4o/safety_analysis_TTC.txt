Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30267
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is relatively close to the Ego vehicle but stationary.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: With 0 velocity, there's no immediate risk; however, proximity requires awareness.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30270
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is at a greater distance laterally and slightly further longitudinally.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Moving away from the Ego vehicle at a gentle speed.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30271
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is far from the Ego vehicle and travelling in a different trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Rapid enough movement and adequate distance negate immediate concern.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30272
- **Distance Risk reason**: There is no movement, but moderate distance maintains buffer.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Stationary state decreases urgency for immediate threat.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30273
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is positioned significantly away.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Fast moving forward and lateral positioning reduce threat.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30274
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned relatively close to the Ego vehicle in the same orientation.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Potential merging or close path, yet no urgent collision course.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30275
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary vehicles with considerate distance.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: No velocity accounts for the low risk of collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30276
- **Distance Risk reason**: Slow movement and reasonable distance maintained.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity negates imminent threat.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30277
- **Distance Risk reason**: Slightly more velocity but distant enough laterally.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Small TTC given velocity doesn't pose immediate risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)
