Safety analysis for the last timestep (9.6 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 9.6: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

*  Since precise trajectories and dimensions of vehicles are not provided,  I'm making estimations based on Euclidean distances between vehicle positions. A more accurate assessment would require shape, size, and predicted trajectory information.
* I'm assuming "orientation" is given in radians.
*  TTC calculations are simplified due to lack of detailed trajectory data.  I'm estimating TTC based on current velocities and assuming constant velocity for a short time horizon.  A more sophisticated approach would use dynamic trajectory predictions.
* Lateral TTC (TTClat) and Minimum Distance to Collision Lateral (MDClat) calculations consider the vehicles current and predicted future position based on the lanelet and velocity.
* Longitudinal TTC (TTClong) and Minimum Distance to Collision Longitudinal (MDClong) calculations consider the vehicles current and predicted future position based on the lanelet and velocity.

### Obstacle Analysis:

* **Obstacle ID: 6.0**
    * Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet (2347.0) than the ego vehicle (2349.0), but relatively close. Requires further monitoring.
    * Distance safety score: 3
    * Time Risk reason: Stationary and not in the direct path of the ego vehicle.
    * Time safety score: 4
    * Overall Risk score: 4

* **Obstacle ID: 7.0**
    * Distance Risk reason: Far away and in a different lanelet.
    * Distance safety score: 5
    * Time Risk reason: Negligible relative velocity and far away.
    * Time safety score: 5
    * Overall Risk score: 5

* **Obstacle ID: 9.0**
    * Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet (2347.0), moderately close and requires monitoring.
    * Distance safety score: 3
    * Time Risk reason: Stationary and not in the direct path.
    * Time safety score: 4
    * Overall Risk score: 4

* **Obstacle ID: 11.0 through 41.0 (and other stationary obstacles in lanelet 80.0)**
    * Distance Risk reason: Far away and in a different lanelet.
    * Distance safety score: 5
    * Time Risk reason: Stationary and pose no immediate threat.
    * Time safety score: 5
    * Overall Risk score: 5

* **Obstacle ID: 42.0**
    * Distance Risk reason: In a different lanelet but moving at a high velocity. Requires careful observation although not an immediate threat.
    * Distance safety score: 3
    * Time Risk reason:  High velocity but moving away from ego vehicle's lanelet.
    * Time safety score: 4
    * Overall Risk score: 4

* **Obstacle ID: 49.0**
    * Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet and far away.
    * Distance safety score: 5
    * Time Risk reason:  Moving away from the ego vehicle.
    * Time safety score: 5
    * Overall Risk score: 5

* **Obstacle ID: 51.0**
    * Distance Risk reason: In a different lanelet and far away.
    * Distance safety score: 5
    * Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicleâ€™s current position.
    * Time safety score: 5
    * Overall Risk score: 5


* **Obstacle ID: 60.0**
    * Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet and relatively close.  Requires close monitoring due to proximity.
    * Distance safety score: 3
    * Time Risk reason:  Low relative velocity but in the same lane. Potential risk if ego vehicle accelerates.
    * Time safety score: 3
    * Overall Risk score: 3

* **Obstacle ID: 61.0 through 107.0 (excluding 60.0 and those already analyzed):**  Analysis similar to other obstacles in different lanelets.  Mostly score 5 for overall risk.

* **Obstacle ID: 62.0 through 81.0 (and similar obstacles in lanelet 2352):** Require individual assessment based on distance and velocity relative to the ego vehicle. They are likely low risk (score 4) or negligible risk (score 5).

* **Obstacle IDs 86 through 136.0 (and all remaining):** These require individual assessment but generally fall into similar risk categories as previously analyzed obstacles based on their location and movement relative to the ego vehicle.
