Safety analysis for the last timestep (9.6 seconds):
### Safety Analysis for Timestep 9.6 seconds:

**Ego Vehicle Information:**
- Position: (6.7962, -8.111)
- Velocity: 0.0152 m/s
- Acceleration: 0.0493 m/s²

**Identified Key Obstacles in Same Lanelet (2349.0):**
1. Obstacle 60: Position(8.7418, -12.2603), Velocity 2.9038
2. Obstacle 72: Position(23.231, -43.2432), Velocity 1.0515

### Obstacle Analysis:

**1. Obstacle 60:**
- **Distance**: Calculating the distance using Euclidean formula:
  \[
  D = \sqrt{(8.7418 - 6.7962)^2 + (-12.2603 + 8.111)^2} \approx \sqrt{(1.9456)^2 + (-4.1493)^2} \approx \sqrt{3.7826} \approx 1.9434 m 
  \]
- **Distance Risk reason**: The ego vehicle is relatively close to the obstacle with a distance of approximately 1.94 m which poses a minimal yet increasing risk as the obstacle has a significant velocity.
- **Distance safety score**: **2** (High Risk)

- **TTC** (Time to Collision):
  - Relative velocity towards the obstacle = |0.0152 + 2.9038| = 2.919 m/s
  - TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity = 1.9434 / 2.919 ≈ 0.6665 seconds
- **Time Risk reason**: Given a TTC of approximately 0.67 seconds, there is a high probability of collision unless immediate evasive action is taken.
- **Time safety score**: **2** (High Risk)

- **Overall Risk Score**: **2** (High Risk)

**2. Obstacle 72:**
- **Distance**: Calculating distance:
  \[
  D = \sqrt{(23.231 - 6.7962)^2 + (-43.2432 + 8.111)^2} \approx \sqrt{(16.4348)^2 + (-35.3542)^2} \approx \sqrt{269.1953 + 1245.0272} \approx \sqrt{1514.2225} \approx 38.9092 m 
  \]
- **Distance Risk reason**: At approximately 38.91 m distance, this obstacle poses no immediate threat.
- **Distance safety score**: **4** (Low Risk)

- **TTC** (Time to Collision):
  - Relative velocity towards the obstacle = |0.0152 + 1.0515| = 1.0667 m/s
  - TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity = 38.9092 / 1.0667 ≈ 36.493 seconds
- **Time Risk reason**: With a TTC of approximately 36.49 seconds, this gives ample time to react.
- **Time safety score**: **5** (Negligible Risk)

- **Overall Risk Score**: **4** (Low Risk)
