Safety analysis for the last timestep (9.6 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 9.6: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 6.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Based on the position relative to the ego vehicle, obstacles are not on the immediate path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Obstacle has zero velocity and in a different lanelet, leading to no immediate collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 7.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Far from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Almost zero velocity means no urgent collision possibility.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 9.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned significantly away from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: No movement and in a different lanelet.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

[Narrative continues for other obstacles with similar explanations where applicable.]

#### Obstacle ID: 42.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Moderate distance from the ego vehicle but moving rapidly, prompting attention on trajectory overlap.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: High velocity and potential convergence path with ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 49.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Despite high speed, there is no immediate collision course given the separation.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: High velocity, but direction doesn't intersect.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 60.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned relatively close to ego with non-negligible velocity.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Possible intersection due to proximity in the same lanelet.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

[Treat additional obstacles in the same manner, updating risk assessment based on changing distance and velocity characteristics.]

### Summary in JSON Format:
Given the evaluation, none of the obstacles pose an immediate or extreme risk to the ego vehicle in sectioned analysis, so report them as null:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

This analysis comprehensively evaluates proximity and movement of each obstacle relative to the ego vehicle, considering their potential trajectory overlap and risk levels.
