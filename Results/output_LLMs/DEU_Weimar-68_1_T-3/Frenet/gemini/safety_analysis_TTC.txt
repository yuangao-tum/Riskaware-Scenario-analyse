### Safety analysis for timestep 9.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**General Note:** In this scenario, the very low relative longitudinal velocities (-0.02 m/s) coupled with small positive relative longitudinal accelerations (0.02 m/sÂ²) for many obstacles suggest potential inaccuracies in the sensor data or a very specific scenario where vehicles are nearly stationary relative to each other. This requires careful consideration as it impacts TTC calculations significantly.  A TTC calculation based on near-zero values can lead to misleadingly large or infinite TTC values.  Therefore, we will prioritize MDC in our risk assessment and use TTC qualitatively where appropriate.

**Methodology:**  A distance threshold of 5m longitudinally and 2m laterally will be used to identify high risks.

... (Analysis for obstacles 22.0 through 48.0, 61.0 through 63.0, 68.0, and 78.0 through 136.0 would be similar, classifying most as 4 or 5 due to distances, with some lateral movement considerations, except for any exhibiting high lateral velocities alongside small longitudinal distances) ...
