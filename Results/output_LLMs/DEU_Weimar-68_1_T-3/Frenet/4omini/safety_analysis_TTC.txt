### Safety analysis for timestep 9.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

---

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### - Obstacle ID: 6.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance (15.86 m) is close, and the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle, indicating a potential immediate risk.
- **Distance safety score**: **1** (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity of -0.02 m/s suggests a potential collision is imminent, hence, very low time (TTC).
- **Time safety score**: **1** (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: **1**

---

#### - Obstacle ID: 9.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance (23.24 m) is manageable, but the obstacle is driving toward the ego car.
- **Distance safety score**: **2** (High Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Given the relative speed (-0.02 m/s), time to collision is concerning.
- **Time safety score**: **2** (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: **2**

---

#### - Obstacle ID: 7.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance (148.7 m) is safe but laterally (-21.55 m) it's approaching.
- **Distance safety score**: **3** (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity (-0.02 m/s) suggests some risk of collision.
- **Time safety score**: **3** (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: **3**

---

#### - Obstacle ID: 11.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance (30.62 m) is safe but it's moving towards the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: **3** (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Similar relative velocity situation as with other similarly distanced obstacles.
- **Time safety score**: **3** (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: **3**

---

#### - Obstacle ID: 40.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance (89.67 m), meaning good space, but still moving toward the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: **4** (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The low relative velocity suggests a more controllable situation.
- **Time safety score**: **4** (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: **4**

---

#### - Obstacle ID: 94.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance (178.21 m), quite far, lateral distance also not a concern.
- **Distance safety score**: **5** (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative speed indicates no immediate collision threat, enabling safe navigation.
- **Time safety score**: **5** (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: **5**

---

#### - Obstacle ID: 92.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance (7.63 m) indicates proximity, and being in front indicates potential immediate threat.
- **Distance safety score**: **1** (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Given the relative motion towards the ego vehicle, immediate collision risk assessed.
- **Time safety score**: **1** (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: **1**

---

#### - Obstacle ID: 104.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance (12.37 m) implies closeness, while also having a lateral aspect of threat.
- **Distance safety score**: **1** (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The lateral and longitudinal velocity adds threat level due to combined movements.
- **Time safety score**: **1** (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: **1**

### Summary in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "6.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

This analysis prioritizes and assigns scores based on how immediate the threat of collision is relative to the provided parameters for each obstacle engaged with the ego vehicle. It considers both proximity and velocity dynamics while emphasizing the need for timely reactions in critical situations.
