### Safety analysis for timestep 9.6: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 6.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is directly in front within the same lane with no lateral offset and a close longitudinal distance of 15.86 m.
   - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** TTC is challenging to calculate precisely but is low due to close proximity. The relative velocity is minimal but heading towards the ego vehicle.
   - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 9.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is directly in front within the same lane with no lateral offset at a moderate longitudinal distance of 23.24 m.
   - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** The moderate distance allows more time for evasive action, but with a relative velocity approaching, cautious monitoring is necessary.
   - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 60.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is extremely close directly behind with a longitudinal distance of -0.06 m.
   - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Extremely short TTC due to very close proximity, with relative velocity approaching, indicating immediate attention needed.
   - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 62.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is close directly behind with a longitudinal distance of -9.04 m.
   - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Short TTC due to closeness, but somewhat mitigated by relative velocity being low.
   - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 64.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is moderately close directly behind with a longitudinal distance of -17.41 m.
   - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Adequate TTC for reaction but requires careful monitoring as it is approaching from behind.
   - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID: 71.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is very close on the right-front with a longitudinal distance of 2.09 m.
   - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Extremely low TTC and lateral movement pose a significant immediate collision risk.
   - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

7. **Obstacle ID: 74.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is to the front-left within a short longitudinal distance of 5.43 m and lateral 7.63 m.
   - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Short TTC with negative velocity indicating movement towards the ego vehicle, requiring swift evasive action.
   - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

8. **All other obstacles** evaluated had negligible to low risk scores due to greater distance, negligible relative movement, or directions leading away from the ego vehicle without imminent collision risk.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "60.0",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  }
}
```

### Additional Notes:
- Obstacle 60.0 poses an extreme risk due to its proximity and position directly behind the ego vehicle.
- Obstacles 71.0 and 74.0 are extremely risky due to their unfavorably close distances and trajectories moving towards the ego vehicle.
- For medium and high-risk obstacles, continuous monitoring and potential evasive actions are recommended to enhance safety.
