### Safety analysis for timestep 9.6: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 6.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The real longitudinal distance is 15.86 m, which is very close, indicating a high risk.
  - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: With a relative velocity of -0.02 m/s, the Time to Collision (TTC) is calculated as \(TTC = \frac{DTClong}{Vrel_long} = \frac{15.86 m}{-0.02 m/s} = -793 m/s > 1\).
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 9.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance is 23.24 m, indicating a manageable distance.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The TTC is calculated as \(TTC = \frac{23.24 m}{-0.02 m/s} = -1162 m/s > 1\).
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 7.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance is 148.7 m, indicating a non-threatening position.
  - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The TTC is calculated as \(TTC = \frac{148.7 m}{-0.02 m/s} > 1\), which is non-threatening.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 11.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance is 30.62 m, indicating acceptable clearance.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The TTC is \(TTC = \frac{30.62 m}{-0.02 m/s} > 1\).
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 18.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance of 38.0 m signifies good separation.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The TTC is \(TTC = \frac{38 m}{-0.02 m/s} > 1\).
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 22.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: A distance of 45.38 m indicates a safe distance.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The TTC is \(TTC = \frac{45.38 m}{-0.02 m/s} > 1\).
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 42.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance of 121.66 m indicates a safe space.
  - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away (relative velocity positive).
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 92.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The distance of 7.63 m indicates immediate proximity.
  - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The TTC is calculated as \(TTC = \frac{7.63 m}{-0.74 m/s} > 1\).
  - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
