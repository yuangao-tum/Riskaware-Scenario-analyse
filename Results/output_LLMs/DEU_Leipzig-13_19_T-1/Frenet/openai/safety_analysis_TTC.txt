### Safety analysis for timestep 4.2 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 3242.0
- Distance Risk reason: The real distance is -97.14 m longitudinally (backward) and -15.44 m laterally (to the right). The obstacle is significantly far behind and to the right, presenting a diminishing risk.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC is 10.25 seconds (97.14 m / 9.47 m/s), which is safe. Lateral TTC is 1.35 seconds (15.44 m / 11.38 m/s), also manageable.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 3243.0
- Distance Risk reason: The distance is 0.0 m longitudinally and -22.39 m laterally. This suggests that it is very close, but exact alignment longitudinally reduces collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: TTC longitudinally is 0 seconds; thus, there is an imminent threat of collision. Laterally, Vrel_lat = 0, so no immediate risk there.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 3244.0
- Distance Risk reason: -36.09 m longitudinally (back), -9.65 m laterally (to the right); the obstacle is moving away longitudinally but closing laterally indicates potential risk.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC is 2.08 seconds and lateral TTC is -2.88 seconds suggests that it is closing rapidly.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 3245.0
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.0 m longitudinally and -28.76 m laterally, indicating very close proximity. This demands attention.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Also, TTC longitudinally is 0 seconds, indicating imminent threat of collision.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1

#### Obstacle ID: 3246.0
- Distance Risk reason: 0.74 m longitudinally (front) and -40.22 m laterally; a very close frontal obstacle increases the risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: TTC longitudinally of 0.14 seconds and lateral colleagues with a negative lateral movement hints potential for collision.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1

#### Obstacle ID: 3247.0
- Distance Risk reason: 8.7 m longitudinally (front) and -11.49 m laterally; reasonably close but not immediate.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC is 1.85 seconds and lateral TTC is -2.34 seconds, potentially problematic.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 3248.0
- Distance Risk reason: -31.76 m longitudinally (back) and -14.17 m laterally; itâ€™s far away and moving away laterally with no threat.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC is 3.97 seconds, totally manageable.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 3249.0
- Distance Risk reason: 2.81 m longitudinally (front) and 2.06 m laterally provides a gentle safety margin.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC of 0.51 seconds but considering it is moving away, not critical.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 3251.0
- Distance Risk reason: 11.19 m longitudinally (in front) and -52.21 m laterally presents minimal risk.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC of 1.70 seconds is manageable.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 3252.0
- Distance Risk reason: -73.17 m longitudinally (back) and -5.16 m laterally indicates distance is quite safe.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC calculates comfortably at 187.3 second, allowing breathing space.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 3253.0
- Distance Risk reason: -9.34 m longitudinally and -22.93 m laterally, provides reasonable distance in both directions.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC at 4.38 seconds gives adequate time.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 3254.0
- Distance Risk reason: -0.17 m longitudinally indicates almost touch distance with exact alignment.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: TTC longitudinally at 0.04 seconds suggests very immediate danger.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1

#### Obstacle ID: 3255.0
- Distance Risk reason: -16.32 m longitudinally (back) suggests it has room, but its closeness means to be cautious.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: TTC longitudinally is critically short.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 3256.0
- Distance Risk reason: -51.41 m longitudinally and 8.44 m laterally indicate distance, decreasing the potential risk.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC is safe; thus, no concern.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4
