Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.2 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.2: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories, dimensions of vehicles, and lanelet shapes are not provided,  I will make reasonable assumptions for illustrative purposes.  I'll use Euclidean distance as a proxy for MDC and estimate TTC based on current velocities and headings. A more rigorous analysis would require more detailed data.  I define a safety buffer distance of 2 meters for MDC and a safety buffer time of 3 seconds for TTC.


**### Obstacle Analysis:**

- **Obstacle ID: 3242**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is relatively far from the ego vehicle laterally and longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's high velocity and heading suggest it's moving away from the ego vehicle's path.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3243**
- Distance Risk reason:  Moderate lateral distance, relatively close longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary, posing a lower risk but should still be monitored.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3244**
- Distance Risk reason:  Moderate lateral and longitudinal distance.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The high velocity and heading suggest the obstacle might cross the ego vehicle's path. Needs careful attention.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 3245**
- Distance Risk reason:  Close longitudinal distance, moderate lateral distance.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Low velocity and heading suggest it might not be a significant threat immediately, but should be observed.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


- **Obstacle ID: 3246**
- Distance Risk reason:  Increasing longitudinal distance, moderate lateral distance.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moderate velocity and diverging heading reduces the risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


- **Obstacle ID: 3247**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively close both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moderate velocity and heading indicate a potential risk, needs monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3248**
- Distance Risk reason:  Moderate distance, potentially in or near ego vehicle's lane.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Low velocity and heading suggest a manageable risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3249**
- Distance Risk reason: Close lateral distance, but in the adjacent lane.  Longitudinally close.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: High velocity and heading towards the ego vehicle's lane raises concern. Requires close attention.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 3251**
- Distance Risk reason:  Increasing longitudinal distance and moderate lateral separation.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Moderate velocity and diverging path reduce risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3252**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Low velocity and heading away from ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 3253**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderate distance, potentially in ego vehicle's lane or nearby.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Stationary, so no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3254**
- Distance Risk reason: Close lateral distance, in the same lane.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Moderate velocity and in the same lane indicates a potential risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 3255**
- Distance Risk reason: Close lateral and longitudinal distance, in the same lane.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Moderate velocity and in the same lane represents a higher risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 3256**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderate distance, but approaching quickly.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: High velocity and heading towards the ego vehicle's path.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2
