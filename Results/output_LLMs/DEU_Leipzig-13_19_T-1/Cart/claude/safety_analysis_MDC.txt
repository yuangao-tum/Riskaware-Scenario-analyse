Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.2 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario and evaluate collision risks for the ego vehicle.

### Key Observations:
1. Ego vehicle is in lanelet 1126.0
2. Several obstacles share or cross the ego vehicle's path
3. Most critical time window is 0-4.2 seconds

### Safety Analysis:

For obstacle 3247 (closest in same lanelet):
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is directly ahead in same lanelet (1126), distance starts at ~20m and closes to ~17m
- Distance safety score: 3 (Moderate risk due to maintaining reasonable following distance)
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity is managed, TTC >10s
- Time safety score: 4 (Low risk due to stable relative velocities)
- Overall Risk score: 3

For obstacle 3249:
- Distance Risk reason: Moving between lanelets 1125/2874, crosses ego's path
- Distance safety score: 2 (High risk due to path intersection)
- Time Risk reason: Higher velocity (12.3 m/s) with crossing trajectory
- Time safety score: 2 (High risk due to potential intersection timing)
- Overall Risk score: 2

For obstacle 3254:
- Distance Risk reason: In lanelet 1126, relatively close proximity (~10m)
- Distance safety score: 2 (High risk due to close following distance)
- Time Risk reason: Similar velocity profile, TTC >8s
- Time safety score: 3 (Moderate risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2

### JSON Summary:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

### Overall Assessment:
While there are several obstacles presenting moderate to high risk (scores of 2-3), none present immediate collision risk (0) or extreme risk (1). The main concerns are:
1. Path crossing with obstacle 3249
2. Close following distance with obstacle 3254
3. Shared lanelet operation with obstacle 3247

The ego vehicle maintains reasonable control and spacing throughout the scenario, though careful monitoring of the identified risk factors is warranted.
