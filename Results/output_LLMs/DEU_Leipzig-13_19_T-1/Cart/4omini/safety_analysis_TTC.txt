Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.2 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.2 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID:** 3242.0
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** The obstacle is in lanelet 667.0 and is moving towards a position that would bring it closer to the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance Safety Score:** 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason:** Given the high speed of the obstacle (13.5392 m/s), the TTC with the ego vehicle is low and presents an imminent risk.
   - **Time Safety Score:** 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 2 (High Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID:** 3243.0
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** This obstacle is stationary (0 m/s) and poses a significant risk due to the ego vehicle's trajectory towards it.
   - **Distance Safety Score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason:** The TTC is very low since the obstacle is stopped.
   - **Time Safety Score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID:** 3244.0
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** The obstacle is in lanelet 667.0 and is moving laterally, bringing it closer to the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance Safety Score:** 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason:** With a speed of 15.6022 m/s, the chance of collision is high, thus the TTC is low.
   - **Time Safety Score:** 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 2 (High Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID:** 3245.0
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** This obstacle is moving but at low speed while remaining close to the ego's path.
   - **Distance Safety Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason:** The velocity is low, granting some time before potential impact.
   - **Time Safety Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID:** 3246.0
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** This moving obstacle is lateral to the ego vehicle and poses moderate risk.
   - **Distance Safety Score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason:** The moderate speed still allows for a safe distance.
   - **Time Safety Score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 4 (Low Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID:** 3247.0
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** Similar lateral movement; the distance is reasonable.
   - **Distance Safety Score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason:** Time to collision is sufficient despite the lateral speed.
   - **Time Safety Score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 4 (Low Risk)

7. **Obstacle ID:** 3248.0
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** The obstacle is moving away and presents minimal risk.
   - **Distance Safety Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason:** The velocity and distance indicate it's not a concern.
   - **Time Safety Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

8. **Obstacle ID:** 3249.0
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** Moderate distance, but with forward movement towards the lanelet where the ego vehicle is present.
   - **Distance Safety Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason:** Velocity provides time, but this could change quickly.
   - **Time Safety Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

9. **Obstacle ID:** 3251.0
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** Approaching obstacle close to the ego vehicle in a high-speed context.
   - **Distance Safety Score:** 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason:** Low TTC due to speed.
   - **Time Safety Score:** 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 2 (High Risk)

10. **Obstacle ID:** 3252.0
    - **Distance Risk Reason:** Position and speed result in minimal risk.
    - **Distance Safety Score:** 4 (Low Risk)
    - **Time Risk Reason:** Slow speed results in a decent time to respond.
    - **Time Safety Score:** 4 (Low Risk)
    - **Overall Risk Score:** 4 (Low Risk)

11. **Obstacle ID:** 3253.0
    - **Distance Risk Reason:** Stationary obstacle presents immediate risk for the ego vehicle.
    - **Distance Safety Score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
    - **Time Risk Reason:** No movement means an immediate risk is present.
    - **Time Safety Score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
    - **Overall Risk Score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

12. **Obstacle ID:** 3254.0
    - **Distance Risk Reason:** This obstacle approaches the ego vehicle's path indicating risk.
    - **Distance Safety Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
    - **Time Risk Reason:** Moderate speed keeps TTC reasonable.
    - **Time Safety Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
    - **Overall Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

13. **Obstacle ID:** 3255.0
    - **Distance Risk Reason:** Moderate approach towards the lanelet puts this obstacle at risk.
    - **Distance Safety Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
    - **Time Risk Reason:** Moderate speed allows for a decent buffer time.
    - **Time Safety Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
    - **Overall Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

14. **Obstacle ID:** 3256.0
    - **Distance Risk Reason:** The obstacle is far in comparison and moving away.
    - **Distance Safety Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - **Time Risk Reason:** Minimal chance for collision due to relative speed.
