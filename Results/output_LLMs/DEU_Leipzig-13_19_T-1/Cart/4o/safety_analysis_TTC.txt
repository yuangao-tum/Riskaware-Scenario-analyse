Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.2 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.2 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 3242**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located further from the ego lanelet and has significant separation, moving at a different angle.

    - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity and acceleration indicate low approaching risk.
    - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score**: 5

11. **Obstacle ID: 3253**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary and located in a distant lanelet.
    - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
    - **Time Risk reason**: Zero velocity minimizes the immediate risk.
    - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score**: 4

12. **Obstacle ID: 3254**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Similar lanelet, converging path potential as aligned.
