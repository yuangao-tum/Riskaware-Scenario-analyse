Safety analysis for the last timestep (1.2 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 1.2s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories and shapes of the vehicles are not provided,  I'll make some simplifying assumptions for the analysis:

* **Point-mass approximation:** Vehicles are treated as points.
* **Constant velocity and acceleration (short-term):** Over the short TTC timeframe, we assume constant velocity and acceleration.
* **Lanelet-based risk assessment:**  Obstacles in different lanelets pose a lower immediate risk unless their trajectories intersect the ego vehicle's path.

**Calculations and Reasoning:**

It's crucial to consider both longitudinal and lateral TTC/MDC.  A low TTC in one direction coupled with a low MDC in the other could still present a high risk.  We lack lateral distance information, making precise TTClat and MDClat difficult to calculate.  We'll primarily use longitudinal information and lanelet context for a qualitative assessment.

**### Obstacle Analysis:**

**- Obstacle ID: 31.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet and slightly behind the ego vehicle. The provided positions suggest a lateral separation as well.  While close, it's not an immediate threat given its current location.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity (11.6 m/s) is much higher than the ego vehicle's (2.4 m/s).  This means the obstacle is rapidly approaching from behind. Even though it is currently behind, the potential for a rapid decrease in longitudinal distance exists.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 325.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and very close longitudinally and laterally.  This poses a significant risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity (8.5 m/s) is significantly higher than the ego vehicle's velocity (2.4 m/s). This increases the risk of a collision, even though the obstacle might be slightly ahead.  The relatively small difference in their x-coordinates indicates they are almost side-by-side.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 344.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is further ahead in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. It presents a lower immediate risk than Obstacle 325.0 due to the greater distance.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's velocity (13.2 m/s) is much higher than the ego vehicle's. However, its position further down the lanelet mitigates the immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 350.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet and behind the ego vehicle.  The y-coordinate difference suggests it's also positioned laterally away from the ego vehicle's path, lessening the risk.
- Distance safety score: 4 
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is moderate (5.2 m/s). Combined with its position behind and to the side of the ego vehicle, the time-related risk is relatively low.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
