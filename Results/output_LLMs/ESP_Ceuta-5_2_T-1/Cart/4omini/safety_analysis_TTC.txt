Safety analysis for the last timestep (1.2 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 1.2: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 31.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is positioned at (615.15529, 710.10506) which is approximately 4.82341 meters away from Ego (619.9787, 713.1752) in the x-direction and 3.07014 meters in the y-direction. Given the velocity of 11.608659 m/s and acceleration of -0.01333, this vehicle is significantly faster than the Ego vehicle. The relative positioning indicates a trajectory that could lead to a collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The time to collision relative to the speed of Ego (2.4114 m/s) against the obstacle's speed of 11.608659 m/s suggests a high probability of collision as both vehicles seem to be moving toward each other. Estimate of TTC is approximately 0.38 seconds.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 325.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at (623.1878, 712.26334), this obstacle is approximately 3.20940 meters away in the x-direction and 0.89284 meters in the y-direction from Ego. This proximity combined with significant speed (8.5199683 m/s) indicates a moderate risk of collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC can be calculated with relative speeds suggesting the risk of the collision is manageable but provides a need for timely reactions. Estimate of TTC is approximately 0.6 seconds.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 344.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (640.98182, 707.5178), the distance from Ego vehicle is more than 20 meters, making this obstacle less concerning in terms of immediate collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative speed is substantial but far from immediate harm, giving plenty of time to alter trajectory if needed. Estimate of TTC is around 4 seconds.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 350.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at (595.49319, 697.10638), this obstacle is substantially far away, with a significant distance from Ego which minimizes the risk of collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Considering the relative speed is lower than Ego's and is moving away, its impact is negligible. Estimate of TTC is approximately 10 seconds.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
