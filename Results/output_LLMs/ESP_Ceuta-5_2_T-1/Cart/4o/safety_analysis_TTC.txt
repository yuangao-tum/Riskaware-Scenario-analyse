Safety analysis for the last timestep (1.2 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 1.2: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 31.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is closely located at a position (615.15529, 710.10506) relative to the ego vehicle. Although in a different lanelet, the proximity could pose a lateral risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk - due to moderate close lateral proximity)
- **Time Risk reason**: The substantial speed difference may lead to convergence, but since they are in different lanelets, the probability of collision is reduced.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk - due to higher velocity and deceleration balancing out)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 325.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at (623.1878, 712.26334), this obstacle is in the forward path with a relatively close distance that can lead to a collision if velocity isn't managed.
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk - positioned directly but slightly ahead in trajectory proximity)
- **Time Risk reason**: Given similar orientation and higher velocity, it may close in quickly unless action is taken.
- **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk - due to similar orientation and higher speed)
- **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 344.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: With its position at (640.98182, 707.5178), this obstacle is well farther out laterally, suggesting low risk of collision.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk - far lateral position, low threat potential)
- **Time Risk reason**: Higher speed and different trajectories lower collision likelihood.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk - moving quickly away from ego's trajectory)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 350.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (595.49319, 697.10638), far from the ego's lanelet position, indicating minimal immediate risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk - distant position reduces collision probability)
- **Time Risk reason**: Although initially fast, the obstacle is decelerating quickly away from the ego vehicle's path.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk - slowing down considerably, diverging paths)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format: 
Since no obstacles have an Overall Risk Score of 0 or 1, both CollisionObstacles and ExtremeRiskObstacle are set to `null`.
