Safety analysis for timestep 1.2 seconds:
```            ### Safety analysis for timestep 1.2 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
            
            ### Obstacle Analysis:
                - Obstacle ID: 31
                - Distance Risk Reason: The longitudinal distance is 0 (collision), and the lateral distance is 2.74, which is medium risk. The relative direction is Left so lateral is considered.
                - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
                - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
                - Overall Distance Safety Score: 3
                - Time Risk Reason: The longitudinal time is 0 (collision), and the lateral time is 0.97 which is high risk. The relative direction being Left focuses on lateral.
                - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
                - Lateral Time Safety Score: 2
                - Overall Time Safety Score: 2
                - Overall Risk Score: 3

            ### Obstacle Analysis:

                - Distance Risk Reason: Both longitudinal and lateral distances are 0, indicating a collision occurred.
                - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
                - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
                - Overall Distance Safety Score: 0
                - Time Risk Reason: Both longitudinal and lateral times are 0, indicating a collision occurred.
                - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
                - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
                - Overall Time Safety Score: 0
                - Overall Risk Score: 0

            ### Obstacle Analysis:
                - Obstacle ID: 344
                - Distance Risk Reason: The longitudinal distance is 17.23, which represents negligible risk, and the lateral distance is 0.0. The relative direction is Behind.
                - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
                - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
                - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
                - Time Risk Reason: The longitudinal time is 1.6 indicating medium risk, with the lateral undetermined due to 0.0.
                - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
                - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
                - Overall Time Safety Score: 3
                - Overall Risk Score: 4

            ### Obstacle Analysis:
                - Obstacle ID: 350
                - Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance of 14.22 (negligible risk), lateral distance of 20.91 (negligible risk). Direction is Front-left, both are considered.
                - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
                - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
                - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
                - Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal time is 4.98 (low risk) and lateral time is infinity (negligible risk).
                - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
                - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
                - Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5
                - Overall Risk Score: 5
