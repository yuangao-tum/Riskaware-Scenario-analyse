Safety analysis for timestep 1.2 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 1.2 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 31
- Relative Direction: Left
- Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle has a longitudinal distance to collision of 0.0 and a lateral distance of 2.74. Since the ego car is aligned with the obstacle longitudinally and it approaches from the left, this presents an extreme and immediate collision risk based on the longitudinal score.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0
- Time Risk Reason: The time to collision is also 0.0 for longitudinal and 0.97 for lateral. Given the longitudinal score is 0, it verifies an imminent risk of collision.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0  
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 3
- Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
- Overall Risk Score: 1

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 325
- Relative Direction: Collision
- Distance Risk Reason: Both longitudinal and lateral distances to collision are 0.0, which signifies an absolute collision risk.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0
- Time Risk Reason: Similarly, with both longitudinal and lateral times to collision at 0, it confirms a collision is unavoidable.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0  
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0
- Overall Risk Score: 0

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 344
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: The longitudinal distance to collision is 17.23 (safe), while the lateral distance is 0.0 (exact alignment). This indicates that there is distance since the ego car is quite far from the obstacle in longitudinal terms.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 2.5
- Time Risk Reason: The longitudinal time to collision is 1.6, and lateral is 0.0 indicating an immediate risk in that direction, but distant longitudinally.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3  
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 1.5
- Overall Risk Score: 2

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 350
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: The longitudinal distance is 14.22 (safe) and lateral distance is 20.91 (safe), indicating no immediate collision risk with the obstacle moving away.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5
- Time Risk Reason: The longitudinal time is 4.98 (safe), with lateral being infinite, indicating no collision risk exists from this obstacle.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4  
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5
- Overall Risk Score: 4
