Safety analysis for timestep 1.2 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 1.2 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 31
- Relative Direction: Left
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0.0, indicating a collision risk longitudinally. DTClat is 2.74, indicating a medium risk laterally. Since the relative direction is left, lateral distance is dominant.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.0
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.0, indicating a collision risk longitudinally. TTClat is 0.97, indicating an extreme risk laterally. Since the relative direction is left, lateral time is dominant.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 1
- Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
- Overall Risk Score: 2
