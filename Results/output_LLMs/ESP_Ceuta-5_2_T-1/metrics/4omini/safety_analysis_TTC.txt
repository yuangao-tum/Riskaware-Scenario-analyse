Safety analysis for timestep 1.2 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 1.2 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 31
- Relative Direction: Left
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance to collision is 0.0, indicating an immediate risk of collision from the left side of the ego vehicle. The lateral distance (2.74) is acceptable, but the critical longitudinal aspect means urgent action is required.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
- Overall Distance Safety Score: DSC = 0 * 0 + 4 * (1) = 0
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal time to collision is 0.0, which indicates an immediate collision risk, while the lateral time (0.97) suggests the vehicle needs to react quickly to the obstacle approaching from the left.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0  
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 2
- Overall Time Safety Score: TSC = 0 * 0 + 2 * (1) = 0
- Overall Risk Score: Risk Score = 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 0 = 0

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 325
- Relative Direction: Collision
- Distance Risk Reason: Both longitudinal and lateral distances to collision are 0.0, indicating a direct collision situation. Immediate action is required and there is no distance available to avoid the collision.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: DSC = 0 * 1 + 0 * 0 = 0
- Time Risk Reason: Both longitudinal and lateral times to collision are 0.0, showing that a collision is imminent without any time available for reaction.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0  
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: TSC = 0 * 1 + 0 * 0 = 0
- Overall Risk Score: Risk Score = 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 0 = 0

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 344
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance to collision is 17.23 indicating safe distance, while lateral distance is 0, suggesting no immediate lateral risk.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
- Overall Distance Safety Score: DSC = 5 * 1 + 3 * 0 = 5
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal time to collision is 1.6 giving enough time for a reaction, while lateral time is not applicable.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3  
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: TSC = 3 * 1 + 0 * 0 = 3
- Overall Risk Score: Risk Score = 0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 3 = 4

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 350
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance to collision is 14.22 with a lateral distance of 20.91 indicating safety from collision risk but not close enough to pose immediate danger.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: DSC = 4 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5 = 4.5
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal time to collision is 4.98 and lateral time is infinite, indicating no imminent danger and allowing full time to passively monitor the obstacle.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4  
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: TSC = 4 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5 = 4.5
- Overall Risk Score: Risk Score = 0.5 * 4.5 + 0.5 * 4.5 = 4.5
