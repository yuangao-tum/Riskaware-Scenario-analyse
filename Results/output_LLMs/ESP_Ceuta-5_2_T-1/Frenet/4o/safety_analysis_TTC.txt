### Safety analysis for timestep 1.2: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 31.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance is 0.0 m, indicating potential immediate collision if longitudinally aligned. Lateral distance of 2.74 m suggests some side clearance but is significantly close.
  - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk due to current proximity and alignment)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal relative velocity of -13.67 m/s indicates the obstacle is approaching rapidly, shortening the time to collision. Lateral closing speed of -2.82 m/s is substantial.
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk due to rapid closing speed)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 325.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Both longitudinal and lateral distances are 0.0 m, indicating a current collision.
  - **Distance safety score:** 0 (Collision)
  - **Time Risk reason:** With a relative velocity barely moving away, there is no effective time to maneuver or prevent the ongoing collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 0 (Collision)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 0 (Collision)

- **Obstacle ID: 344.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance of -17.23 m suggests it is behind the ego vehicle. Lateral distance is perfectly aligned but provides no immediate collision risk at this point.
  - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk due to potential rear-end if not managed)
  - **Time Risk reason:** With a longitudinal relative velocity of 10.79 m/s moving towards the ego car, the time to potential rear collision is decreasing.
  - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk due to rapid approach but control still possible)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 350.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is at a longitudinal distance of 14.22 m and a lateral distance of 20.91 m, indicating a safe separation.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk due to sufficient separation)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Despite negative longitudinal velocity, it's moving away laterally at a high rate, reducing the risk of immediate collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)
