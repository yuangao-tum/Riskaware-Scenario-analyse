### Safety analysis for timestep 1.2s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 31.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is to the left of the ego vehicle with a lateral distance of 2.74m, posing a potential lateral collision risk.  The longitudinal distance is 0, suggesting the obstacle is aligned longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Lateral relative velocity is -2.82 m/s indicating the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle laterally. The longitudinal velocity and acceleration do not contribute significantly to collision risk in this scenario.  We cannot calculate a precise TTC without more sophisticated motion models, but the negative relative lateral velocity is a concern.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 325.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in direct collision course with the ego vehicle (both longitudinal and lateral distances are 0).
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is already colliding with the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 344.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle at a safe longitudinal distance of 17.23m. Lateral distance is 0, indicating alignment.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  While the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally with a relative velocity of 10.79 m/s, the substantial distance mitigates immediate risk. Longitudinal acceleration also points to increasing relative speed, requiring ongoing monitoring.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 350.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located diagonally ahead and to the left (14.22m longitudinal, 20.91m lateral) posing a low immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The negative longitudinal relative velocity (-2.86 m/s) indicates the obstacle is getting closer longitudinally.  However, the positive and increasing lateral relative velocity (5.14 m/s, 3.0 m/sÂ²) means it's moving further away laterally. The overall risk appears to be diminishing.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
