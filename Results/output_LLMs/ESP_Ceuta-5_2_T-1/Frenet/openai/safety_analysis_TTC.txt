### Safety analysis for timestep 1.2: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 31.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is 2.74 m away laterally, with a longitudinal distance of 0.0 m. It is nearing the ego vehicle laterally from the left side.
- **Distance safety score**: **2** (High Risk) - Close to collision path.
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  - Longitudinal TTC: 0.0 m / 6.11 m/s = 0.0 s (immediate collision).
  - Lateral TTC: 2.74 m / (-2.82 m/s) = -0.97 s (moving towards collision).
- **Time Risk reason**: The TTC is negative for lateral movement, indicating imminent collision.
- **Time safety score**: **1** (Extreme Risk) - Immediate collision likely.
- **Overall Risk score**: **1** (Extreme Risk) - Immediate action is required.

#### Obstacle ID: 325.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is positioned directly in front (0.0 m) and at a lateral distance of 0.0 m, indicating direct overlap.
- **Distance safety score**: **0** (Collision) - Immediate collision.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC: 0.0 m / 6.11 m/s = 0.0 s (immediate collision).
  - Lateral TTC: 0.0 m / 0.24 m/s = 0.0 s (also indicating imminent impact).
- **Time Risk reason**: Both TTC values indicate immediate collision.
- **Time safety score**: **1** (Extreme Risk) - Immediate collision.
- **Overall Risk score**: **0** (Collision) - Immediate collision requires urgent action.

#### Obstacle ID: 344.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle at 17.23 m longitudinally and 0.0 m laterally. 
- **Distance safety score**: **4** (Low Risk) - Sufficient distance to react.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC: 17.23 m / 10.79 m/s = 1.60 s (acceptable time to collision).
  - Lateral TTC: 0.0 m / 0.57 m/s = 0.0 s (immediate potential collision if reversing).
- **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal movement poses a low risk, while lateral movement indicates potential for immediate danger.
- **Time safety score**: **3** (Medium Risk) - Manageable but needs attention.
- **Overall Risk score**: **3** (Medium Risk) - Moderate collision risk manageable with reactions.

#### Obstacle ID: 350.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is 14.22 m longitudinally and 20.91 m laterally, indicating controlled distance.
- **Distance safety score**: **4** (Low Risk) - Safe distance overall.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC: 14.22 m / (-2.86 m/s) = -4.96 s (indicating a loss of distance).
  - Lateral TTC: 20.91 m / 5.14 m/s = 4.07 s (safe distance from lateral collision).
- **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal part indicates risk of losing distance, but lateral movement is still manageable.
- **Time safety score**: **2** (High Risk) - Needs attention in longitudinal component.
- **Overall Risk score**: **3** (Medium Risk) - Manageable with attention.
