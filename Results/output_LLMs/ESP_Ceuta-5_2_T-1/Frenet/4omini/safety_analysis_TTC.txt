### Safety analysis for timestep 1.2 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 31.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The real distance is longitudinally 0.0 m and laterally 2.74 m. The obstacle is in the left lane of the ego car. Since the distance is minimal, this indicates a very high risk of coming into contact.
  - **Distance safety score**: **1**
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is longitudinally -13.67 m/s (obstacle approaching), and the obstacle is moving laterally towards the ego vehicle. Given the longitudinal distance at 0.0 m, there is an almost immediate risk of collision. Therefore, the calculated TTC would be very low.
  - **Time safety score**: **1**
  - **Overall Risk score**: **1** (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 325.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: There is a real distance of 0.0 m both longitudinally and laterally, indicating a direct collision scenario with no space to evade.
  - **Distance safety score**: **0**
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is longitudinally 6.11 m/s and laterally 0.24 m/s. Since there is zero distance, the scenario is already in collision; hence, TTC is technically unmeasurable, leading to extreme urgency.
  - **Time safety score**: **0**
  - **Overall Risk score**: **0** (Collision)

- **Obstacle ID: 344.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is longitudinally -17.23 m (behind) and laterally 0.0 m, implying the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle from behind, but at a distance that increases between the vehicles as the ego car is moving forward.
  - **Distance safety score**: **4**
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is longitudinally 10.79 m/s (the obstacle is moving at a noticeable speed towards the ego vehicle). Given that the distance is fairly substantial, there is adequate time to react, indicating low likelihood of collision in the near future.
  - **Time safety score**: **4**
  - **Overall Risk score**: **4** (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 350.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The real distance is longitudinally 14.22 m and laterally 20.91 m. The vehicle is moving away from the ego vehicle laterally and is currently at a sufficient distance in both dimensions, indicating manageable risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: **4**
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is longitudinally -2.86 m/s (the obstacle is possibly slowing down), and laterally moving away. Given these considerations and the distances involved, there is ample time to react.
  - **Time safety score**: **4**
  - **Overall Risk score**: **4** (Low Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "325.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "31.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

In conclusion, Obstacle 325.0 poses an immediate collision risk, represented with a score of 0, whereas Obstacle 31.0 also presents an extreme risk with a score of 1. Remaining obstacles show manageable or low risk levels.
