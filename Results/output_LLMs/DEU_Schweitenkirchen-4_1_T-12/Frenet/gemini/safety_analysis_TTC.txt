### Safety analysis for timestep 5.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Methodology:**

To calculate TTC (Time-to-Collision), we use the following formula, handling cases where relative velocity is zero or close to zero to avoid division by zero errors:

* **TTC_long:**  `if Vrel_long < -0.1 : DTClong / abs(Vrel_long) else: 1000` (Large value indicating no collision risk in the foreseeable future).
* **TTC_lat:** `if abs(Vrel_lat) > 0.1: DTClat / abs(Vrel_lat) else: 1000`

MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision) is not directly calculable from the given data as we lack information on the ego vehicle and obstacle dimensions.  However, we will infer risk based on current DTClat and DTClong along with their relative motion.

**Scoring System:**

We'll apply a rule-based scoring system for TTC, Distance, and overall risk.  

* **Distance:**  Primarily based on real distance and relative direction. Closer obstacles in the same or converging lateral/longitudinal directions get lower scores.
* **TTC:** Primarily based on calculated TTC.  Lower TTC values correspond to lower safety scores.
* **Overall:** Considers both TTC and Distance to determine the final risk.


### Obstacle Analysis:

```
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "426.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 0
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```


- **Obstacle ID: 1.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Far away, moving away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, large TTC.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


- **Obstacle ID: 2.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally, TTC concerning.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2



... (Repeat analysis for all obstacles using the methodology and format above) ...

- **Obstacle ID: 426.0**

- **Obstacle ID: 431.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Very close, slightly behind but moving faster.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Close behind, overtaking risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1


- **Obstacle ID: 434.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Close behind, same lateral direction.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Close behind, but some margin.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**Important Note:** This analysis relies on instantaneous values. Continuous monitoring and recalculation are crucial for a robust safety system. The lack of object dimensions limits MDC accuracy. This detailed response provides the framework, you will need to programmatically apply it to every obstacle in your simulation to get the full analysis.  Provide the complete list of obstacle data in a structured format (e.g., CSV or JSON), and I can demonstrate a more automated analysis.
