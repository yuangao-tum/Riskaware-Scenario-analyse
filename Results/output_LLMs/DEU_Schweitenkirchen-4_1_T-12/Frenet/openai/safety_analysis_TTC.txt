### Safety analysis for timestep 5.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 1.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance is significantly large (893.79 m) combined with a lateral distance (382.51 m) indicates a low possibility of collision.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity suggests the obstacle is moving away, and TTC is substantial given its distance.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 2.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is low (193.95 m) and lateral distance is moderate (78.58 m). The obstacle is approaching.
  - Distance safety score: 2
  - Time Risk reason: With a significant negative relative velocity (longitudinal: -43.48 m/s) and potential imminent impact, risk is higher; calculates to a very low TTC.
  - Time safety score: 1
  - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 4.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Significant longitudinal distance (259.32 m) and moderate lateral (63.62 m) means good separation from the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity indicates it's moving away, leading to ample space. 
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 5.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance (665.51 m) and lateral distance (246.47 m), very far apart; face no threat. 
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away, contributing to good margins.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 7.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Moderate longitudinal distance (594.84 m) and lateral distance (238.96 m) suggest safety.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Negative relative velocities suggest the obstacle has a potential risk of collision; instills caution but not immediate danger.
  - Time safety score: 3
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 8.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Great longitudinal (1038.95 m) and lateral distances indicate minimal risk.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Moving away indicates a decrease in collision risk.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 9.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Moderate distances of (495.83 m longitudinal, 157.51 m lateral); assess with regard to relative motion.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Relative velocity indicates the obstacle is moving away, but still requires monitoring.
  - Time safety score: 4
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 10.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Mid distances with an approaching obstacle (393.65 m and 147.72 m).
  - Distance safety score: 2
  - Time Risk reason: High relative velocity indicates quick approach. These metrics yield a high collision risk.
  - Time safety score: 1
  - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 11.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Approaching at close proximity (600.17 m and lateral 237.8 m).
  - Distance safety score: 3
  - Time Risk reason: Similar dynamics to obstacle 10. It's moving toward the ego car with high velocity.
  - Time safety score: 1
  - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 12.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Similar to obstacle 2 with low longitudinal (304.6 m) and moderate lateral distance (110.19 m).
  - Distance safety score: 3
  - Time Risk reason: High relative approach velocity indicates serious awareness required; yields a low TTC.
  - Time safety score: 1
  - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 14.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Close proximity (224.06 m longitudinal and 80.16 m lateral) with a moving approach detected.
  - Distance safety score: 2
  - Time Risk reason: High relative velocity indicates it is coming too fast, leading to an urgent situation.
  - Time safety score: 1
  - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 25.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Moderate longitudinal (354.4 m) and lateral distance (132.18 m); approaching.
  - Distance safety score: 2
  - Time Risk reason: High longitudinal velocity warns a significant risk of collision; low TTC.
  - Time safety score: 1
  - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 46.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Large distances with no immediate threat (682.69 m and 248.05 m).
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Receding velocity indicates no collision risk.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 426.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: In a collision state as it's co-located with the ego vehicle (0.0 m).
  - Distance safety score: 0
  - Time Risk reason: Co-aligned, means itâ€™s already in collision or about to collide.
  - Time safety score: 0
  - Overall Risk score: 0

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "426.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "2.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
