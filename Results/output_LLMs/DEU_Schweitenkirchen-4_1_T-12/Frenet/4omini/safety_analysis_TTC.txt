### Safety analysis for timestep 5.4: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 1.0
    - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance (893.79 m) and lateral distance (382.51 m) indicate significant separation from the ego vehicle, with the obstacle moving away.
    - **Distance safety score**: 5
    - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity indicates it is moving away, presenting no immediate concerns for time to collision.
    - **Time safety score**: 5
    - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID**: 2.0
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal (193.95 m) and lateral (78.58 m) distances imply proximity. The obstacle is approaching rapidly, indicating a risk.
    - **Distance safety score**: 2
    - **Time Risk reason**: High negative longitudinal velocity (-43.48 m/s) suggests a very high probability of collision within a short time frame.
    - **Time safety score**: 1
    - **Overall Risk score**: 1

- **Obstacle ID**: 4.0
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal (259.32 m) and lateral (63.62 m) distances suggest distance but with moderate movement away.
    - **Distance safety score**: 4
    - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity indicates it's moving away, hence no risk of immediate collision.
    - **Time safety score**: 5
    - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID**: 5.0
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Sufficient distance (665.51 m longitudinal and 246.47 m lateral) with long-term moving away motion.
    - **Distance safety score**: 5
    - **Time Risk reason**: Present motion is away from the ego vehicle, thus no pressing issues for time to collision.
    - **Time safety score**: 5
    - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID**: 7.0
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Close longitudinal (594.84 m) and lateral (238.96 m) distances with approaching movement presents a notable risk.
    - **Distance safety score**: 2
    - **Time Risk reason**: Very high negative velocities in both directions indicate a scenario that warrants immediate attention.
    - **Time safety score**: 1
    - **Overall Risk score**: 1

- **Obstacle ID**: 8.0
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Far distance (1038.95 m longitudinal, 480.86 m lateral) with movement away signals negligible risk.
    - **Distance safety score**: 5
    - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away with a positive relative velocity, indicating no risk.
    - **Time safety score**: 5
    - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID**: 9.0
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Well-spaced (495.83 m longitudinal, 157.51 m lateral) and moving away suggests safety.
    - **Distance safety score**: 4
    - **Time Risk reason**: No concern for imminent collision with significant distance.
    - **Time safety score**: 5
    - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID**: 10.0
    - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is (393.65 m longitudinal, 147.72 m lateral) approaching very swiftly.
    - **Distance safety score**: 2
    - **Time Risk reason**: High negative velocities signal immediate risk of collision.
    - **Time safety score**: 1
    - **Overall Risk score**: 1
