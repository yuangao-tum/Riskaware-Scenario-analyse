Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.4 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 9.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle's lanelet with a velocity of 31.7612 while the ego vehicle is moving at 10.7304, indicating a potential lateral collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk due to close proximity)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The Time to Collision (TTC) is approximately 4.8 seconds considering both longitudinal and lateral direction. This indicates a high probability of a collision if proper actions are not taken.
  - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk due to reduced time to react)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 41.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is moving towards it at a speed of 29.8601. The distance between them is minimal and poses a close risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC is approximately 4.2 seconds indicating a highly probable collision path.
  - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 218.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is notably on an intersecting path from a different lanelet while moving at 25.2401 m/s. The proximity is concerning as the obstacle moves at a significant speed.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: With a reduced velocity for the ego vehicle, collision is possible if it continues on its path without yield.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 151.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving towards the lanelet of the ego vehicle but is considerably far away, allowing space for potential maneuvers.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC indicates approximately 6.2 seconds, which is a sufficient timeframe for potential avoidance actions.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 64.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is identified to be considerably distanced from the ego vehicle with no immediate threat posed, moving in a different lanelet.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Identified to have a TTC above 10 seconds, indicating no collision risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
