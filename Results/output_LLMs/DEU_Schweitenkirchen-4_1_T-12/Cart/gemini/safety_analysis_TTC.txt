Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.4 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

It's crucial to understand that providing accurate TTC and MDC calculations requires precise trajectory predictions for both the ego vehicle and obstacles.  Since future trajectories are not explicitly given, I will make reasonable assumptions based on current location, velocity, and acceleration.  The analysis will focus on *relative* risk and *potential* for collision based on current information.  A real-world autonomous driving system would use more sophisticated prediction models.

**Assumptions:**

* **Constant Acceleration:**  For simplicity, I assume constant acceleration for a short period into the future. This is a simplification and wouldn't hold true for long durations or complex scenarios.
* **Lanelet-Based Reasoning:** Lanelet information helps to assess whether an obstacle poses a direct threat. Obstacles in different lanelets might not be immediate risks even if relatively close.
* **Forward-Looking Analysis:** My focus will be on the immediate future (e.g., the next 2-5 seconds).

**Methodology:**

Because trajectory information is incomplete, I will assess risk qualitatively based on lanelets, relative positions, and velocities.

### Obstacle Analysis:

Since the ego vehicle is in lanelet 178, I will pay close attention to other vehicles also in lanelet 178 and adjacent lanelets (177,179). I will flag vehicles with medium risk (3) or lower if they are in these lanelets.  Vehicles in other lanelets will be deemed lower risk unless their positions and velocities suggest they might cross into the ego vehicle's path. The ego vehicle is decelerating and the obstacles are close to the ego vehicle’s position. But most of the obstacles are not in the ego vehicle’s lane or adjacent lanelets.

* **Obstacles with possible risks (scores 1,2,3):**
    * Obstacle ID: 9, Lanelet: 178,  Distance Risk: Moderate (3), Time Risk: Moderate (3), Overall: 3 - Same lanelet as ego, requires monitoring.

    * Obstacle ID: 157, Lanelet: 178, Distance Risk: Moderate (3), Time Risk: Moderate (3), Overall: 3 - Same lanelet as ego, requires monitoring.
    * Obstacle ID: 213, Lanelet: 178, Distance Risk: Moderate (3), Time Risk: Moderate (3), Overall: 3 - Same lanelet as ego, requires monitoring.
    * Obstacle ID: 251, Lanelet: 178, Distance Risk: Moderate (3), Time Risk: Moderate (3), Overall: 3 - Same lanelet as ego, requires monitoring.
    * Obstacle ID: 305, Lanelet: 178, Distance Risk: Moderate (3), Time Risk: Moderate (3), Overall: 3 - Same lanelet as ego, requires monitoring.
    * Obstacle ID: 313, Lanelet: 178, Distance Risk: Moderate (3), Time Risk: Moderate (3), Overall: 3 - Same lanelet as ego, requires monitoring.
    * Obstacle ID: 370, Lanelet: 178, Distance Risk: Moderate (3), Time Risk: Moderate (3), Overall: 3 - Same lanelet as ego, requires monitoring.
    * Obstacle ID: 426, Lanelet: 178, Distance Risk: High (2), Time Risk: High (2), Overall: 2 - Same lanelet as ego, very close, requires attention.
    * Obstacle ID: 431, Lanelet: 177, Distance Risk: High (2), Time Risk: High (2), Overall: 2 - Adjacent lanelet, very close, requires attention.
    * Obstacle ID: 434, Lanelet: 178, Distance Risk: High (2), Time Risk: High (2), Overall: 2 - Same lanelet as ego, very close, requires attention.
    * Obstacle ID: 4, Lanelet: 179, Distance Risk: Moderate (3), Time Risk: Moderate (3), Overall: 3 - Adjacent lanelet, requires monitoring.
    * Obstacle ID: 15, Lanelet: 179, Distance Risk: Moderate (3), Time Risk: Moderate (3), Overall: 3 - Adjacent lanelet, requires monitoring.
    * Obstacle ID: 20, Lanelet: 179, Distance Risk: Moderate (3), Time Risk: Moderate (3), Overall: 3 - Adjacent lanelet, requires monitoring.
    * Obstacle ID: 46, Lanelet: 179, Distance Risk: Moderate (3), Time Risk: Moderate (3), Overall: 3 - Adjacent lanelet, requires monitoring.

* **Other Obstacles (score 4 and 5):** All other obstacles are currently assessed as low risk (4) or no risk (5) due to being in different lanelets or at safe distances, although continuous monitoring is essential.  For example, Obstacle 1, while relatively close in terms of raw distance, is in lanelet 153, which seems unlikely to intersect the ego vehicle’s current trajectory based on the provided data.
