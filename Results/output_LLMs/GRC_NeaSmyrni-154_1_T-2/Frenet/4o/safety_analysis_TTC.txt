### Safety analysis for timestep 3.1 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

To analyze the safety risks, we'll address each obstacle based on their relative position, longitudinal and lateral distances, velocities, and accelerations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 20066.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is in direct collision with the ego vehicle as indicated by DTClong = 0.0 m and DTClat = 0.0 m.
   - **Distance safety score:** 0 (Collision)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Not applicable, as the collision is already occurring.
   - **Time safety score:** 0 (Collision)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 0 (Collision)

2. **Obstacle ID: 20067.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Behind the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of -13.86 m, the obstacle is not directly in the path but possesses a higher velocity moving toward the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC is not critical for this position considering the negative distance and velocity indicates potential closing.
   - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 20064.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Front with a decreasing longitudinal distance of 12.39 m. It is moving towards and poses high risk.
   - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Close proximity necessitates immediate action.
   - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 20063.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Front with longitudinal distance of 19.37 m, moving in the same trajectory.
   - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Significant proximity with continuous closing distance.
   - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 20062.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Front with longitudinal distance of 26.35 m, moving toward ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Manageable proximity but needs attention soon.
   - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID: 20061.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Front with longitudinal distance 33.33 m, co-linear motion.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC duration allows the safe reaction.
   - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

7. **Obstacle ID: 20059.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned front with a 40.31 m longitudinal margin.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity and acceleration suggest reasonable control over the scenario given the distance.
   - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

8. **Obstacle Identification for Remaining Detected Objects (e.g., IDs 20055.0 to 20052.0, and others)**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: These obstacles are farther longitudinal distances, ranging from 47.29 m and above when considering the same directional movement and vehicle dynamics.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Sufficient distance ensures no immediate action is required.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
