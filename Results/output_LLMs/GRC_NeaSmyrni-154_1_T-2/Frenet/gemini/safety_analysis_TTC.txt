### Safety analysis for timestep 3.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

It's crucial to note that the provided data lacks ego vehicle velocity and acceleration.  This makes accurate TTC calculations impossible. We can only infer risk based on distances and the fact that obstacles are generally moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally. Lateral movement is negligible for most obstacles.  I will assume a minimum safe distance of 5 meters longitudinally and 2 meters laterally for assigning risk scores.


- **Obstacle ID: 20025.0**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Longitudinally distant, moderately close laterally. In front-right.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason:  Approaching but currently far. TTC cannot be precisely calculated.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20027.0**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Longitudinally distant, moderately close laterally. In front-right.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching but currently far. TTC cannot be precisely calculated.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20028.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinally distant, laterally safe. In front-left.

- **Obstacle ID: 20066.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Collision reported! Zero distance.
    - Distance safety score: 0
    - Time Risk reason:  Already colliding.
    - Time safety score: 0
    - Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 20067.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Behind the ego vehicle, moderately close.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away from ego longitudinally.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 4


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20066.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20064.0", 
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
```
Note: Obstacle 20064.0 is selected as an example for `ExtremeRiskObstacle` as it is likely the closest obstacle besides the one already in collision.  Several other obstacles might also qualify depending on the exact thresholds used for extreme risk based on distance. Since TTC cannot be calculated, proximity becomes the main factor.  A comprehensive risk assessment requires the ego vehicle's motion information.
