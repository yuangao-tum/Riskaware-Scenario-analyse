Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.1 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario for collision risks between the ego vehicle and other obstacles.

Analysis:

1. The ego vehicle is in lanelet 1803.0, moving with decreasing velocity (from 9.5142 to 1.2626 m/s) and varying acceleration.

2. Key obstacles in the same lanelet (1803.0):
- Obstacle 20050 to 20063: Stationary obstacles
- Obstacle 20064: Very slow moving (almost stationary)
- Obstacle 20066: Moving with decreasing velocity (10.2016 to 5.2422 m/s)
- Obstacle 20067: Moving with decreasing velocity (10.2389 to 7.42 m/s)

Detailed Risk Analysis:

1. For obstacles 20050-20063:
- Distance Risk: Medium (Score: 3)
- Time Risk: Low (Score: 4)
- Overall: 3.5 (Low-Medium Risk)
Reason: Static obstacles with sufficient spacing

2. For obstacle 20064:
- Distance Risk: Medium (Score: 3)
- Time Risk: Low (Score: 4)
- Overall: 3.5 (Low-Medium Risk)
Reason: Very slow movement, maintaining safe distance

3. For obstacle 20066:
- Distance Risk: High (Score: 2)
- Time Risk: Medium (Score: 3)
- Overall: 2.5 (Medium-High Risk)
Reason: Closer proximity, higher relative velocity

4. For obstacle 20067:
- Distance Risk: Medium (Score: 3)
- Time Risk: Medium (Score: 3)
- Overall: 3 (Medium Risk)
Reason: Maintaining safer distance than 20066

No obstacles present immediate collision risk (Score 0) or extreme risk (Score 1) in this scenario. The ego vehicle is maintaining safe distances and decelerating appropriately.

JSON Summary:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

The analysis shows that while there are some risks present, particularly with obstacle 20066, the overall scenario maintains acceptable safety margins with no immediate collision risks or extreme risk situations.
