Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.1 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories, obstacle dimensions, and ego vehicle dimensions are unavailable, a simplified analysis is performed.  We primarily use position data and lanelet information to assess risk.  "Distance to Collision" (DTC) represents the Euclidean distance between the ego vehicle and the obstacle. "TTC" is approximated based on current velocities and assumes constant velocity.  A more sophisticated analysis would involve predicting future trajectories and incorporating vehicle dimensions.  We define a safety buffer distance of 3 meters for negligible risk.  If the DTC is within this buffer, risk increases.
