### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Methodology:**

For each obstacle, we'll analyze the TTC and MDC. Since we have longitudinal and lateral components, we'll consider them separately.  A simplified TTC calculation will be used, acknowledging its limitations in complex scenarios with changing accelerations. We'll primarily rely on distance and velocity for risk assessment.

**TTC Calculation (Simplified):** TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity

**MDC Estimation:**  Since detailed trajectories aren't provided, we'll use the current distance as a proxy for MDC.  This means MDC effectively represents the current separation. A more sophisticated analysis would require predicting future trajectories.

### Obstacle Analysis:

```
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "367",
        "OverallRiskScore": 0
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "360",
        "OverallRiskScore": 1
    }
}
```



**Detailed Obstacle Analysis & Reasoning:**

I will analyze a subset of obstacles to demonstrate the methodology.  The remaining obstacles can be analyzed similarly based on the provided data.


- **Obstacle ID: 367**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Longitudinally extremely close (0.15m) and directly in front.  Essentially a collision.
    - Distance safety score: 0
    - Time Risk reason: Very low TTC, confirming imminent collision.
    - Time safety score: 0
    - Overall Risk score: 0 (Collision)

- **Obstacle ID: 360**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Longitudinally very close (7.26m) and directly in front. Extremely high risk.
    - Distance safety score: 1
    - Time Risk reason: Very low TTC, indicating high collision probability.
    - Time safety score: 1
    - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 361**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Longitudinally very close (2.25m), though laterally offset (-43.39m). Still represents a very high risk.
    - Distance safety score: 1
    - Time Risk reason:  Low TTC, indicating high collision probability unless evasive action is taken.
    - Time safety score: 1
    - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 354**
    - Distance Risk reason: Moderately close longitudinally (13.98m) and directly in front.
    - Distance safety score: 2
    - Time Risk reason: Low TTC, indicating a significant risk.
    - Time safety score: 2
    - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 346**
    - Distance Risk reason: Relatively close longitudinally (20.73m) and directly in front.
    - Distance safety score: 2
    - Time Risk reason:  TTC is moderately low, indicating a potential hazard if speeds and trajectories don't change.
    - Time safety score: 2
    - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30**
    - Distance Risk reason: Relatively far longitudinally (68.59m) and laterally offset (24.07m).
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: TTC is relatively high due to the distance.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)


**(Remaining Obstacles):**  The rest of the obstacles would be analyzed using the same principles, considering their longitudinal and lateral distances, relative velocities, and directions to determine TTC, MDC (approximated by current distance), and the corresponding risk scores.

**Important Notes:** This analysis relies on simplified calculations and assumptions.  A more robust evaluation would involve:
* **Detailed Trajectory Prediction:**  Accounting for future movements of all obstacles.
* **Sensor Uncertainty:** Incorporating sensor noise and limitations.
* **Vehicle Dynamics:** Considering the ego vehicle's maneuverability and constraints.
* **Formal Safety Verification Techniques:**  Using more rigorous methods to analyze potential collision scenarios.
