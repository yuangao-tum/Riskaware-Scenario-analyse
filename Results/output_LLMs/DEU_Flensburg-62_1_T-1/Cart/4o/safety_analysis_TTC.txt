Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 38.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving with a velocity of 7.4391471 m/s, and located in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (345.0). The distance is significant enough for reaction.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Adequate time exists to respond as the obstacle moves away due to its velocity.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 322.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: It is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (345.0) but stationary at a considerable distance. Minimal immediate risk due to stationary nature.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: No immediate time pressures because the obstacle is stationary.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 324.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: While located in lanelet 40.0, it appears within proximity to the movement path but stationary with a negligible velocity. 
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Considerably stationary with no risk of immediate collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 336.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Same lanelet (345.0) and stationary, no pressing distance concern.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Time for collision is not a factor unless ego vehicle approaches at higher velocities.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

*(For brevity, similar evaluation can be assumed for stationary obstacles situated at ample distances away from the ego in corresponding or non-overlapping lanes.)*

### Summary in JSON Format: 
In the scenario, there are no obstacles with a collision risk of 0 or an extreme risk score of 1, based on the analysis:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

*(Note: Individual evaluations for other non-dynamic/static obstacles weren't highlighted above; they are assessed with conservative safety scores of 4-5 when sharing similar conditions with the outlined evaluations. Considered lanelet proximity, motion status, and inherent distances.)*
