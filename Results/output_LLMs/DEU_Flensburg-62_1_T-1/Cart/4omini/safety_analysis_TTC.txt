Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.3 seconds):
Let's evaluate the scenario step by step, focusing on the identified obstacles, calculating Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC), and assigning corresponding risk scores.

### Identifying Relevant Obstacles:
The ego vehicle (Ego) is located in lanelet 345.0. Therefore, we will focus on obstacles located either in lanelet 345 or those that are on a collision course.

### Calculating Metrics:
**Ego Vehicle Parameters:**
- Position: (455.7845, -68.322)
- Velocity: 1.9157 m/s
- Acceleration: -0.4173 m/s²

We will compare the ego vehicle’s trajectory with the identified obstacles. The distance and time metrics will be calculated primarily based on their longitudinal separation.

For each obstacle in lanelet 345.0, we will find:
1. Distance to the ego vehicle.
2. Relative velocities if applicable to calculate TTC.

**Obstacle Identifications and Calculations:**

### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
- **Obstacle ID: 38.0**
  - Position: (345.36355, -28.863337)
  - Velocity: 7.4391471 m/s
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance from Ego is significant enough that they are not on a direct collision path. 
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving toward the ego vehicle at 7.4391 m/s while the Ego is moving at 1.9157 m/s, increasing risk but manageable.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 346.0**
  - Position: (479.69319, -76.504242)
  - Velocity: 5.6935893e-05 m/s (static)
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Sufficient distance to the ego vehicle and located in the same lanelet.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: No functional threat as it's not traveling toward the primary trajectory of the ego vehicle.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 325.0**
  - Position: (493.99256, -79.684768)
  - Velocity: 0 m/s (static)
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is also in the lanelet but several meters distant, presenting low risk in a lateral context.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: No movement towards the ego vehicle indicates no imminent risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 354.0**
  - Position: (473.21474, -74.601006)
  - Velocity: 0.00047820534 m/s (very slow)
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Reasonably distant from the ego, presenting a low risk of a direct collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Minimal speed implies that even with lateral drift, no significant risk is present.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 350.0**
  - Position: (478.21987, -110.42476)
  - Velocity: 1.1357199e-05 m/s (static)
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Similar to above, no immediate danger due to location.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Static with no factor for increasing risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

### Additional Findings:
Despite the presence of multiple obstacles, none pose a direct collision risk under the current parameters, as the worst case is a 'Medium Risk' rating with no collisions or extreme risk obstacles present. 

Overall assessment indicates the need for continual situational awareness as the Independent dynamic movements of static and dynamic obstacles modify risks as positions and velocities change.
