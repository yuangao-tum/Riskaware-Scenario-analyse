Safety analysis for the last timestep (12.1 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 12.1: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30202.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle but is approximately 6.12 meters away (based on calculations). With a velocity of 8.0112 m/s, it appears to be approaching rapidly.
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
  
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity between the ego vehicle and this obstacle is significant (8.0112 m/s - 2.7558 m/s), leading to a Time to Collision (TTC) of approximately 3.49 seconds.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30203.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is in a different lanelet with a greater distance (>15 meters) from the ego vehicle, resulting in a lesser risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  
- **Time Risk reason**: The TTC with this obstacle is also favorable at approximately 5.8 seconds even at its own speed of 6.8998 m/s and the ego's lower speed.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

---

#### Obstacle ID: 30204.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is further away and not in the same lanelet. The distance is considerable, thus having minimal risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: Even though this obstacle is moving, it does not pose a collision risk in the time frame evaluated, resulting in TTC around 6.5 seconds.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

---

#### Obstacle ID: 30206.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Similar situation as that of Obstacle 30203.0. Its distance is quite far for a potential collision.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: The movement does not pose imminent danger to the ego vehicle. A longer TTC of about 7.0 seconds.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

---

#### Obstacle ID: 30207.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located at a safe distance from the ego vehicle, presenting no chance of immediate collision.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: Reflecting the same trends, this obstacle has a TTC value of around 8 seconds. Movement speed does not affect ego vehicle safety.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

---

#### Obstacle ID: 30208.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle's distance from the ego vehicle indicates low immediate risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: The TTC remains safe, above 5 seconds.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

---

#### Obstacle ID: 30209.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The distance from the ego vehicle allows for safe maneuvering without regard for immediate collision.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: The movement is significantly away from a risk scenario, above 7 seconds of TTC.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)
