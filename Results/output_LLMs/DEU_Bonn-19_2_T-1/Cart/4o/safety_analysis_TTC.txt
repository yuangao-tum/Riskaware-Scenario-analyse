Safety analysis for the last timestep (12.1 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 12.1 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30202.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Both the ego vehicle and obstacle 30202.0 are located within the same lanelet (491.0), indicating a potential longitudinal interaction. The direct trajectory overlap reduces the minimum distance to collision due to parallel paths.
  - **Distance safety score:** 2
  - **Time Risk reason:** With a higher velocity (8.0112) and positive acceleration (1.4369) compared to the ego vehicle, obstacle 30202.0 poses a medium time-to-collision risk unless the ego vehicle increases velocity or alters trajectory.
  - **Time safety score:** 2
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30203.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle 30203.0 is located in a different lanelet (1366.0), maintaining significant lateral distance from the ego vehicle's path. The lateral separation implies minimal collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** Despite moderate velocity, the lateral positioning ensures minimal time-related risk. The lanes do not converge within a short distance.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30204.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned well away in lanelet 133.0, the minimal intersection risk is due to sufficient lateral clearance.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Despite accelerating, the path and position render it negligible for collision imminence.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30206.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle 30206.0 is in lanelet 451.0, with lateral and longitudinal distance providing adequate separation.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** The combination of moderate velocity and differing trajectory ensures ample time for evasive action.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30207.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Located in lanelet 451.0, no direct line intersection with the ego trajectory exists, ensuring safe distances.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** Given the low velocity and positions, lateral and longitudinal times provide no immediate collision threat.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30208.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned in lanelet 133.0, with significant distance within the lateral direction, indicating remote collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Both low relative speed and separate lane trajectory suggest negligible imminent threat.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30209.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** In lanelet 451.0, the sufficient lateral and longitudinal separation from the ego lane ensures minimal risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** Low velocity and positioning maintain a non-threatening interaction, largely eliminating collision probability.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4
