Safety analysis for the last timestep (12.1 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario for collision risks.

Key observations:
1. Ego vehicle is traveling in lanelet 451 initially, then moves to 1579, 1577, and finally 491
2. Several obstacles share or intersect these lanelets

Detailed Analysis:

1. Obstacle 30201:
- Starts in same lanelet (451) and crosses path
- MDC starts at ~12m and closes to ~6m
- TTC varies but maintains reasonable separation
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk Score: 4

2. Obstacle 30206:
- In same lanelet (451)
- MDC starts large (~16m) and maintains safe distance
- Relative speeds are low
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time safety score: 4 
- Overall Risk Score: 4

3. Obstacle 30202:
- Crosses path with ego
- MDC gets to ~5m at closest point
- High relative velocity creates moderate risk
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk Score: 2

4. Obstacle 30207:
- In same lanelet but far ahead
- Large separation maintained
- No immediate collision risk
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk Score: 5

Most critical interactions:
- Obstacle 30202 presents the highest risk due to path crossing and closer distances
- No imminent collisions detected
- No extreme risk situations identified

JSON Summary:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Overall, while there are some close interactions, particularly with Obstacle 30202, proper spacing and speeds are maintained throughout the scenario. No immediate collision risks or extreme risk situations are identified. The ego vehicle appears to be operating safely within acceptable parameters.
