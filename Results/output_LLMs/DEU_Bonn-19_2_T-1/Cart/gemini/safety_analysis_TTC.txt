Safety analysis for the last timestep (12.1 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 12.1: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories, dimensions of vehicles, and lanelet geometries aren't provided,  I'm making simplified calculations based on Euclidean distances and straight-line projections. A more robust analysis would require detailed map information and vehicle dynamics.  I'm assuming a safety "bubble" around the ego vehicle, where TTC and MDC values within this bubble trigger lower safety scores.

**Calculations and Reasoning:**

First, calculate the Euclidean distance between the ego vehicle and each obstacle.  Then, consider their relative velocities to estimate TTC.  Due to the lack of precise trajectory information, a simplified approach is used for TTC:  TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity. This assumes straight-line movement, which is a limitation.

**### Obstacle Analysis:**

- **Obstacle ID: 30202**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 30202 is in the same lanelet (491) as the ego vehicle and relatively close. Distance is approximately 1.3 meters.
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocity suggests a likely collision in the near future.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30203**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30203 is in a different lanelet and further away, posing less immediate risk. Distance is approximately 16.9 meters.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Although the distance is significant, the relative motion needs monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)
