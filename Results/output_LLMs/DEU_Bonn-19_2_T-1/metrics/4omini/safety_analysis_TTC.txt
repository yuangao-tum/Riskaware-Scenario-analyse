Safety analysis for timestep 12.1 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 12.1 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30202
- Relative Direction: Collision
- Distance Risk Reason: Immediate collision risk as DTC (0.0, 0.0) indicates exact alignment, leading to a LongDSC of 0 and a LatDSC of 0.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 0 (Collision Risk)
- Time Risk Reason: Immediate collision risk since TTC (0.0, 0.0) indicates zero time to collision, resulting in a LongTSC of 0 and a LatTSC of 0.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 0 (Collision Risk)
- Overall Risk Score: 0

### Obstacle Analysis:
