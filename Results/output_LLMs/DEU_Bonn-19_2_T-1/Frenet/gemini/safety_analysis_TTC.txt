### Safety analysis for timestep 12.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30202.0
- **Distance Risk reason:**  The obstacle is in direct collision with the ego vehicle (DTClong = 0.0m, DTClat = 0.0m).
- **Distance safety score:** 0
- **Time Risk reason:**  The obstacle is already colliding, hence TTC is effectively zero.
- **Time safety score:** 0
- **Overall Risk score:** 0

- **Obstacle ID:** 30203.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located behind the ego vehicle but approaching longitudinally (DTClong = -12.84m, Vrel_long = 2.58 m/s) and laterally (DTClat = 0.0m, Vrel_lat = 4.38m/s).
- **Distance safety score:** 2
- **Time Risk reason:**  TTClong is approximately 5 seconds. Lateral movement needs attention but doesn't pose immediate risk given the current longitudinal separation.
- **Time safety score:** 2
- **Overall Risk score:** 2

- **Obstacle ID:** 30204.0
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Located behind and to the right, approaching both longitudinally and laterally.  The distance is relatively large, but the closing velocity needs monitoring.
- **Distance safety score:** 3
- **Time Risk reason:** TTClong is large.  Lateral motion is a concern but not immediately dangerous.
- **Time safety score:** 3
- **Overall Risk score:** 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 30206.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Although laterally approaching, the obstacle is moving away longitudinally.  Lateral distance is significant.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** No longitudinal collision risk due to separating motion. Lateral velocity warrants observation.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4


- **Obstacle ID:** 30207.0
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Moving away longitudinally, significant lateral separation.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** No longitudinal collision risk.  Lateral motion needs monitoring but not an immediate threat.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30208.0
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Located behind and to the right, approaching both longitudinally and laterally, but at a larger distance.
- **Distance safety score:** 3
- **Time Risk reason:** TTClong is large. Lateral motion needs attention but is not immediately dangerous due to the larger longitudinal separation.
- **Time safety score:** 3
- **Overall Risk score:** 3


- **Obstacle ID:** 30209.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Moving away longitudinally, reasonable lateral separation.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** No longitudinal collision risk. Lateral motion needs monitoring but not an immediate threat.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4
