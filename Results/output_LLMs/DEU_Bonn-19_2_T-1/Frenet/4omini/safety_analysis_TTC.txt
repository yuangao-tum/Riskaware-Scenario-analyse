### Safety analysis for timestep 12.1 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30202.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The ego vehicle is at an exact longitudinal and lateral distance of 0.0 m to this obstacle. 
   - Distance safety score: 0 (Collision risk)
   - Time Risk reason: TTC cannot be calculated as the vehicles are at the same position, indicating an imminent collision.
   - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 0 (Collision)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30203.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Located 12.84 m behind the ego vehicle, well outside immediate collision range.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal velocity (2.58 m/s) indicates that the obstacle is approaching but due to the distance, there is manageable time before collision.
   - Time safety score: 3 (Medium risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30204.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: 23.89 m behind and offset laterally by 3.13 m. Safe distance from the ego vehicle.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Approaching at longitudinal speed (2.32 m/s), manageable time to react is present.
   - Time safety score: 3 (Medium risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 30206.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: 5.77 m longitudinally and 17.94 m laterally behind. It is relatively far enough to not pose immediate threat.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The longitudinal relative velocity (-3.64 m/s) indicates moving away; thus, no imminent collision risk is present.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 30207.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: 1.09 m longitudinally and 35.35 m laterally behind. Very close longitudinally, which could imply risk.
   - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Although the ego vehicle is approaching the obstacle at a relative velocity of -3.11 m/s longitudinally, the lateral distance gives a slight buffer for reaction. 
   - Time safety score: 3 (Medium risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 2 (High risk)

6. **Obstacle ID: 30208.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: It is 34.42 m longitudinally and 5.93 m laterally behind, indicating sufficient space for safety.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle with a velocity of 1.17 m/s longitudinally, but the distance allows for safe reaction time.
   - Time safety score: 4 (Low risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low risk)

7. **Obstacle ID: 30209.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: It is 3.34 m away longitudinally and 26.98 m laterally behind the ego vehicle.
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The longitudinal velocity of -3.34 m/s shows itâ€™s moving away, reducing the risk of collision but the short distance does require attention.
   - Time safety score: 4 (Low risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium risk)
