### Safety analysis for timestep 12.1: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30202.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Both longitudinal and lateral distances are 0.0 m, meaning the obstacle is either in collision or co-located with the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score:** 0
  - **Time Risk reason:** With longitudinal relative velocity of 5.24 m/s and lateral velocity of 0.48 m/s, there is an immediate collision. Since the distance is 0.0 m, TTC is practically 0 seconds.
  - **Time safety score:** 0
  - **Overall Risk score:** 0

- **Obstacle ID: 30203.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is -12.84 m (behind) indicates a clear space, but it's getting closer due to motion towards the ego car.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 
  - **Time Risk reason:** Relative velocities indicate it will reach 0 m in 12.84 m / 2.58 m/s = 4.97 seconds. This is manageable.
  - **Time safety score:** 4
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30204.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance of -23.89 m and lateral distance -3.13 m, indicates it is a bit further left behind but approaching.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3
  - **Time Risk reason:** At a relative velocity of 2.32 m/s longitudinally, it will take about 23.89 m / 2.32 m/s = 10.3 seconds to reach the ego vehicle.
  - **Time safety score:** 4
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30206.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance of -5.77 m is concerning as it approaches, although it is moving away longitudinally.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** Negative relative longitudinal velocity indicates it is pulling away (but with a lateral approach).
  - **Time safety score:** 4
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30207.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance of -1.09 m and lateral -35.35 m indicates it's very close but further away laterally.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3
  - **Time Risk reason:** The negative longitudinal relative velocity indicates it's moving away, making the collision risk less probable.
  - **Time safety score:** 4
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30208.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance -34.42 m means it's a significant distance away behind; however, it's approaching laterally.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** The distance means it will take time to reach, combined motion still avoids collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 4
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30209.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance of -3.34 m and lateral -26.98 m suggests a close distance but lateral movement is increasing.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3
  - **Time Risk reason:** It is moving away longitudinally with a negative velocity, indicating less urgency.
  - **Time safety score:** 4
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3
