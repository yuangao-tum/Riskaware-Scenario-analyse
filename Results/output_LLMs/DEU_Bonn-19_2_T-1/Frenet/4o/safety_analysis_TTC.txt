### Safety analysis for timestep 12.1 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30202.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: With both longitudinal and lateral distances at 0.0 m, the obstacle is directly at the point of collision with the ego car, indicating the highest risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 0
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is already in collision; hence TTC is effectively 0.
  - **Time safety score**: 0
  - **Overall Risk score**: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 30203.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is 12.84 m behind the ego car but aligned laterally, reducing immediate threat.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2
  - **Time Risk reason**: Moving towards the ego car with moderate velocity and acceleration indicates a potential future threat if not addressed.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30204.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is relatively far at -23.89 m longitudinally and -3.13 m laterally, reducing immediate risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Moderate approach velocity and acceleration imply potential future risk if trajectory remains unchanged.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30206.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: At -5.77 m longitudinally and -17.94 m laterally, the obstacle remains at considerable distance, and motion suggests it's moving away longitudinally, reducing risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Given relative motion away from ego car longitudinally, time risk is minimal.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30207.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is far laterally (-35.35 m) but closer longitudinally (-1.09 m). However, moving away long term mitigates collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Moving away laterally and longitudinally considerably reduces risk over time.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30208.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is at -34.42 m longitudinally and -5.93 m laterally, posing limited immediate risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Given approach velocity towards the ego car, there's a moderate potential risk over time.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30209.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: At -3.34 m longitudinally and moving away from this trajectory, with -26.98 m laterally provides space and reduced risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Moving away longitudinally combined with slight lateral motion towards makes minimal time risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4
