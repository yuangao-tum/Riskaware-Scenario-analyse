Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.4 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario for potential collisions:

1. Analyzing vehicles in the same lanelet (1966.0) as ego vehicle:
- Obstacle 30810.0 starts in the same lanelet but changes to lanelet 4275.0

2. Detailed Analysis:

Obstacle 30810.0:
- Initially closest to ego vehicle
- Starting distance ~19m ahead
- Decelerating from 13.6 to 0 m/s
- Relative velocities decrease over time
- MDC: ~15m minimum
Time Risk reason: Large initial speed difference but decreasing due to deceleration
Time safety score: 4 (Low risk due to decreasing relative velocity)
Distance Risk reason: Maintains safe following distance
Distance safety score: 4
Overall Risk score: 4

Obstacle 30808.0:
- Different lanelet (4277/1978)
- Lateral separation maintained
- Comes to stop
Time Risk reason: No direct collision path
Time safety score: 5
Distance Risk reason: Sufficient lateral separation
Distance safety score: 5
Overall Risk score: 5

Other obstacles (30805.0, 30806.0, 30807.0):
- Different lanelets
- Significant lateral separation
- No intersection with ego trajectory
Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Key Findings:
1. No immediate collision risks identified
2. The main vehicle of interest (30810.0) maintains safe separation
3. All other vehicles are in different lanelets with sufficient separation
4. The ego vehicle's deceleration profile is appropriate for the scenario
5. No obstacles have risk scores of 0 or 1, indicating no collision or extreme risk situations

This scenario appears to demonstrate safe vehicle behavior with appropriate spacing and speed management.
