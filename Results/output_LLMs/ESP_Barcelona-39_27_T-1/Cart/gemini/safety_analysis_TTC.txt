Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.4 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.4: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* **Lanelet Information Crucial:**  Lanelet information is vital for accurate assessment.  While provided, a map visualization would greatly enhance the analysis. I'm assuming lanelet numbers indicate relative positions (e.g., 4275 and 4278 are adjacent lanes).
* **Lateral Distance Definition:**  "Lateral" is assumed to be perpendicular to the ego vehicle's heading.
* **TTC Calculation:** Requires both position and velocity vectors.  I'll make educated guesses based on orientations and speeds, but precise TTC needs more detailed vector information.
* **MDC Calculation:**  This analysis uses Euclidean distance as a proxy for MDC, acknowledging that true MDC depends on vehicle shapes and trajectories.

**Calculations and Reasoning (Illustrative Example - Obstacle 30810):**

* **Obstacle ID: 30810**
* Ego Position: (291.442, 5.1941)
* Obstacle 30810 Position: (294.5163, 2.1166)
* Delta X:  294.5163 - 291.442 = 3.0743
* Delta Y: 2.1166 - 5.1941 = -3.0775
* Euclidean Distance (proxy for MDC): sqrt(3.0743^2 + (-3.0775)^2) ≈ 4.35 meters
* Ego Velocity: 5.9172 (Assuming primarily longitudinal)
* Obstacle 30810 Velocity: 0
* *TTC Estimation (Simplified):* If the ego vehicle were heading directly towards the obstacle (unlikely given lanelet info), longitudinal TTC might be roughly Delta X / Ego Velocity  ≈ 3.0743 / 5.9172 ≈ 0.52 seconds. However, this is a crude estimate. Lateral velocity components are unknown, making precise TTC difficult.


**Obstacle Analysis:**

- **Obstacle ID: 30805**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively close laterally and longitudinally. In adjacent lanelets.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Potentially short TTC if the ego vehicle continues straight without lane change.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30806**
- Distance Risk reason: Further away, likely in a different lane.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Longer TTC due to distance and potential opposing direction.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30807**
- Distance Risk reason: Very close laterally, in adjacent lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Potentially very short TTC if ego doesn't maintain lane.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30808**
- Distance Risk reason: Close laterally and longitudinally. In adjacent lanelets.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Potentially short TTC.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30810**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively close, possibly in same or adjacent lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Potentially short TTC if paths converge.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)
