Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.4 seconds):
To evaluate the potential collision risks for the ego vehicle navigating through the scenario, we first need to identify any obstacles that are in the same lanelet or trajectory as the ego vehicle (lanelet 4275.0). After identifying the relevant obstacles, we then need to compute the Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) for each obstacle.

### Step 1: Identify Obstacles in the Same Lanelet
The ego vehicle is present in lanelet 4275.0. Among the listed obstacles, only the obstacle 30807.0 is in the same lanelet (4278.0 is adjacent and may not pose a direct threat). Therefore, we will focus on obstacle 30807.0 for our analysis.

### Step 2: Calculate Metrics

**Ego Vehicle:**
- Position: (291.442, 5.1941)
- Velocity: 5.9172 (forward, moving to the right)
- Acceleration: -3.8764 (decelerating)

**Obstacle 30807.0:**
- Position: (281.9602, -0.1387)
- Velocity: 0.019 (essentially stationary)
- Acceleration: -0.0184 (decelerating slightly)

#### Distance Calculation
To calculate the Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC), we find the straight-line distance between the ego vehicle and the obstacle. The distance can be calculated as:

\( \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \)

Plugging in the coordinates:

\( \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(291.442 - 281.9602)^2 + (5.1941 - (-0.1387))^2} \)

Calculating gives:

\( \text{Distance} \approx \sqrt{(9.4818)^2 + (5.3328)^2} \approx \sqrt{89.6559 + 28.4877} \approx \sqrt{118.1436} \approx 10.87 \, \text{units} \)

#### Time to Collision (TTC) Calculation
Given that the driving speed is 5.9172 with an approaching angle towards obstacle 30807.0, we need to determine how quickly that distance would close. The obstacle is essentially stationary so:

- **Relative velocity (V_rel)** of the ego vehicle towards the obstacle = ego speed (5.9172) - obstacle speed (0.019) â‰ˆ 5.8982.
  
Using the formula \( \text{TTC} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Velocity}} \):

\( \text{TTC} = \frac{10.87}{5.8982} \approx 1.84 \text{ seconds} \)

### Step 3: Provide Detailed Evaluation

### Safety analysis for timestep <3.4 seconds>:
Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30807.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The minimum distance of 10.87 units to the obstacle is significant, but as the relative motion is straightforward, it poses a risk if no action is taken.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: The TTC of 1.84 seconds suggests there is a moderate risk as the ego must react promptly to prevent an impending conflict.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: Given the lowest score of 3 and 4, the overall risk would take the lower score which is 3 (Medium Risk).

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

### Conclusion
In this scenario, there are no immediate collisions (score 0) or extreme risks (score 1). There is a medium risk identified for obstacle 30807.0 indicating the need for attention from the ego vehicle, but it does not present an imminent collision threat.
