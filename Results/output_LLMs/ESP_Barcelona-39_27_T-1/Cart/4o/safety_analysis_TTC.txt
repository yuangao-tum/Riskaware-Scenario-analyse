Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.4 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.4: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30805
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is located in lanelet 1979.0, a different lanelet from the ego vehicle (4275.0), with a significant lateral displacement (-10.669 m). There is no collision risk based on distance.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The velocity of the obstacle is 0.0, indicating it is stationary. Given the lateral offset, there is no significant time to collision concern.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30806
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is far from the ego vehicle in terms of lateral displacement (-40.9814 m) and located in lanelet 936.0, significantly diverging from the ego vehicle's lanelet.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity is low (1.9198 m/s) with a very minimal acceleration, indicating negligible risk of convergence. The distance and orientation further mitigate collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30807
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 4278.0, which is next to the ego's lanelet. However, the relative direction and minimal lateral distance (-5.3328 m) are of small concern, but not alarming.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's movement is nearly negligible (velocity 0.019 m/s), indicating low risk of any sudden lateral movement towards the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30808
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in lanelet 1978.0, adjacent to the ego's trajectory, with moderate yet manageable lateral displacement (-8.1399 m).
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary (velocity 0.0), further reducing immediate time-based collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30810
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 1976.0, close to the ego vehicle (3.638 m distance), with negligible risk due to current orientation and relative displacement.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: The stationary status (velocity 0.0) substantially lowers any immediate time risk of collision.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```
In conclusion, based on the given positions, velocities, lanelets, and orientation, there is no immediate collision risk detected in this scenario. All obstacles should be monitored, but no extreme or collision-level risks are identified.
