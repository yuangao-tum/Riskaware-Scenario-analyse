Safety analysis for timestep 3.4 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30805
- **Relative Direction:** Front-right
- **Distance Risk Reason:** The longitudinal distance to collision is 0.19, which is less than 0.5, indicating an extreme risk of collision. The lateral distance is 8.84, which is safe. This emphasizes the urgency of the situation.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 1  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 4
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 2.5 → Rounding down results in **DSC = 2**.
- **Time Risk Reason:** The longitudinal time to collision is 0.03, indicating an extreme risk. The lateral time is infinite, meaning it poses no risk laterally. This highlights the critical need for immediate reaction.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 1
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 5
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 3 → Rounding down results in **TSC = 3**.
- **Overall Risk Score:** 0.5 * 2 + 0.5 * 3 = 2.5 → Rounding down results in **Risk Score = 2**.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30806
- **Relative Direction:** Front-right
- **Distance Risk Reason:** The longitudinal distance to collision is 23.8 (safe) and the lateral distance is 42.9 (safe), indicating minimal risk.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 5
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 5.0 → Rounding down results in **DSC = 5**.
- **Time Risk Reason:** The longitudinal time to collision is 3.99 (safe), and the lateral time is 22.35 (safe), indicating no risk.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 4
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 5
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 4.5 → Rounding down results in **TSC = 4**.
- **Overall Risk Score:** 0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 4 = 4.5 → Rounding down results in **Risk Score = 4**.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30807
- **Relative Direction:** Right
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Exact longitudinal alignment (0.0) indicates a collision risk. The lateral distance is 8.9 (safe), but the lack of longitudinal distance safety leads to a critical collision risk.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 0  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 4
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 0.0 → Rounding down results in **DSC = 0**.
- **Time Risk Reason:** The longitudinal time to collision is 0.0, indicating immediate collision risk. The lateral time is large (safe).
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 0
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 5
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 2.5 → Rounding down results in **TSC = 2**.
- **Overall Risk Score:** 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 2 = 1.0 → Rounding down results in **Risk Score = 1**.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30808
- **Relative Direction:** Front-right
- **Distance Risk Reason:** The longitudinal distance is 0.08 (extreme risk), while the lateral distance is 5.34 (relatively safe). The overall situation indicates an urgent risk.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 1  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 4
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 2.5 → Rounding down results in **DSC = 2**.
- **Time Risk Reason:** The longitudinal time to collision is 0.01, indicating an extreme risk, while lateral time is infinite (safe). Urgent actions are needed.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 1
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 5
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 3 → Rounding down results in **TSC = 3**.
- **Overall Risk Score:** 0.5 * 2 + 0.5 * 3 = 2.5 → Rounding down results in **Risk Score = 2**.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30810
- **Relative Direction:** Collision
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Both longitudinal and lateral distances are 0.0, indicating an imminent collision.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 0  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 0
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 0.0 → Rounding down results in **DSC = 0**.
- **Time Risk Reason:** Both longitudinal and lateral times are 0.0, confirming an immediate collision situation.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 0
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 0
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 0.0 → Rounding down results in **TSC = 0**.
- **Overall Risk Score:** 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 0 = 0.0 → Rounding down results in **Risk Score = 0**.
