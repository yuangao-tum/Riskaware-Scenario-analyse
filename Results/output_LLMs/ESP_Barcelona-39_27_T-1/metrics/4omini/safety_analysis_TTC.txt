Safety analysis for timestep 3.4 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID:** 30805  
   **Relative Direction:** Front-right  
   **Distance Risk Reason:** Longitudinal DTC is 0.19 (Risk Level 1: Extreme Risk) and Lateral DTC is 8.84 (Risk Level 4: Low Risk). Due to the front-right alignment and the very close longitudinal distance, the overall distance safety score reflects a significant risk.  
   **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 1  
   **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 4  
   **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 2.5 (Rounded Down to 2)  
   **Time Risk Reason:** Longitudinal TTC is 0.03 (Risk Level 1: Extreme Risk) and Lateral TTC is Infinity (Risk Level 5: Negligible Risk). The critical longitudinal timing contributes substantially to the risk score.  
   **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 1  
   **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 5  
   **Overall Time Safety Score:** 3 (0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 5)  
   **Overall Risk Score:** 3 (0.5 * 2 + 0.5 * 3)  

2. **Obstacle ID:** 30806  
   **Relative Direction:** Front-right  
   **Distance Risk Reason:** Longitudinal DTC is 23.8 (Risk Level 5: Negligible Risk) and Lateral DTC is 42.9 (Risk Level 5: Negligible Risk). The considerable distances suggest no immediate threat.  
   **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 5  
   **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 5  
   **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 5 (Rounded Down to 5)  
   **Time Risk Reason:** Longitudinal TTC is 3.99 (Risk Level 4: Low Risk) and Lateral TTC is 22.35 (Risk Level 5: Negligible Risk). The longitudinal timing poses minimal risk.  
   **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 4  
   **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 5  
   **Overall Time Safety Score:** 4.5 (0.5 * 4 + 0.5 * 5)  
   **Overall Risk Score:** 4.75 (0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 4.5)   

3. **Obstacle ID:** 30807  
   **Relative Direction:** Right  
   **Distance Risk Reason:** Longitudinal DTC is 0.0 (Risk Level 0: Collision) and Lateral DTC is 8.9 (Risk Level 4: Low Risk). The exact longitudinal alignment poses an absolute collision risk.  
   **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 0  
   **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 4  
   **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 2 (Weighted by dominant direction)  
   **Time Risk Reason:** Longitudinal TTC is 0.0 (Collision Risk) and Lateral TTC is 277776.4 (Risk Level 5: Negligible Risk). There is an immediate threat due to the longitudinal alignment.  
   **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 0  
   **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 5  
   **Overall Time Safety Score:** 2.5 (0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 5)  
   **Overall Risk Score:** 1.25 (0.5 * 2 + 0.5 * 2.5)  

4. **Obstacle ID:** 30808  
   **Relative Direction:** Front-right  
   **Distance Risk Reason:** Longitudinal DTC is 0.08 (Risk Level 1: Extreme Risk) and Lateral DTC is 5.34 (Risk Level 4: Low Risk). The close longitudinal distance indicates significant risk.  
   **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 1  
   **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 4  
   **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 2.5 (Rounded Down to 2)  
   **Time Risk Reason:** Longitudinal TTC is 0.01 (Risk Level 1: Extreme Risk) and Lateral TTC is Infinity (Risk Level 5: Negligible Risk). Immediate risk due to longitudinal alignment.  
   **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 1  
   **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 5  
   **Overall Time Safety Score:** 3 (0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 5)  
   **Overall Risk Score:** 2.5 (0.5 * 2 + 0.5 * 3)  

5. **Obstacle ID:** 30810  
   **Relative Direction:** Collision  
   **Distance Risk Reason:** Both longitudinal and lateral DTCs are 0.0 (Collision Risk). Immediate collision threat exists.  
   **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 0  
   **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 0  
   **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 0 (Collision)  
   **Time Risk Reason:** Both longitudinal and lateral TTCs are 0.0 (Collision Risk). Immediate collision threat exists.  
   **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 0  
   **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 0  
   **Overall Time Safety Score:** 0 (Collision)  
   **Overall Risk Score:** 0 (Collision)
