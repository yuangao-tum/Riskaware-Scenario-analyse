### Safety analysis for timestep 3.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30805.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is positioned at a very close longitudinal distance of 0.19 m and lateral distance of -8.84 m. Being in the front-right indicates it is slightly lateral to the ego vehicle's trajectory.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Given the relative velocity of -5.92 m/s, the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle at a rapid rate. The longitudinal acceleration may slightly mitigate this, but the situation remains critical.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30806.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at a longitudinal distance of 23.8 m and lateral distance of -42.9 m, it poses significantly less risk, being further away compared to other obstacles.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: With negative longitudinal relative velocity moving towards the ego but still a considerable gap, there is reasonable time to react.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30807.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is very close at 0.0 m longitudinally and -8.9 m laterally. Even though it is to the right, the proximity is alarming.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle has a high potential for collision given the minimal longitudinal distance and negative velocity.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30808.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Dangerously close at 0.08 m longitudinally and -5.34 m laterally from the front-right position.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: High likelihood of collision due to very short separation distance and relative velocity towards the ego at -5.92 m/s.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30810.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at exactly 0.0 m in both longitudinal and lateral measurements, indicating a current collision state, thus classifying as an active collision situation.
  - **Distance safety score**: 0 (Collision)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Since relative velocities are -5.92 m/s in the longitudinal plane, the obstacle is already in an unavoidable collision, with no time to react appropriately.
  - **Time safety score**: 0 (Collision)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 0 (Collision)
