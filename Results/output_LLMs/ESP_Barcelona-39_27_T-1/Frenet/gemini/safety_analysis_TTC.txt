### Safety analysis for timestep 3.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30805.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is very close longitudinally (0.19m) and moderately close laterally (-8.84m) in the front-right.  This represents a high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Closing velocity is high (-5.92 m/s) indicating a likely collision if the current motion continues. Though acceleration is positive, the short distance makes it difficult to avoid.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 30806.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is relatively far longitudinally (23.8m) and laterally (-42.9m) in the front-right. This presents a lower risk currently.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Closing velocities longitudinally and laterally suggest potential future risk if no evasive action is taken.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30807.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is very close laterally (-8.9m) to the right and at the same longitudinal position (0.0m) as the ego vehicle. This poses a serious collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Lateral closing velocity is significant, with negative relative longitudinal velocity further increasing the risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 30808.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is extremely close longitudinally (0.08m) and close laterally (-5.34m) in the front-right. This is extremely dangerous and indicates an almost certain collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: High closing velocity (-5.92 m/s) with minimal longitudinal separation indicates imminent collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 30810.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle has zero distance both longitudinally and laterally. This indicates a collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal relative velocity at the point of collision suggests the vehicles are impacting.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0
