### Safety analysis for timestep 3.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30805.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is 0.19 m longitudinally and -8.84 m laterally (front-right), indicating a very close distance longitudinally with significant lateral clearance. 
  - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal relative velocity is -5.92 m/s, resulting in a TTC = 0.19 m / 5.92 m/s = 0.032 seconds. This is confirmed as immediate collision risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30806.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is 23.8 m longitudinally and -42.9 m laterally (front-right). The distance is substantial longitudinally and laterally, thus indicating a lower risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal relative velocity is -5.96 m/s, resulting in a TTC = 23.8 m / 5.96 m/s ≈ 3.99 seconds. Significant time before potential collision gives a low risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30807.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle position is 0.0 m longitudinally and -8.9 m laterally (right). This directly poses an immediate collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal relative velocity is -5.9 m/s, yielding a TTC = 0.0 m / 5.9 m/s = 0 seconds, indicating imminent collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30808.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is 0.08 m longitudinally and -5.34 m laterally (front-right). This proximity suggests immediate collision.
  - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal relative velocity is -5.92 m/s, leading to a TTC = 0.08 m / 5.92 m/s ≈ 0.013 seconds, confirming an urgent collision risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30810.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** This is in direct collision with the ego car (0.0 m longitudinally and laterally).
  - **Distance safety score:** 0 (Collision)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocity is -5.92 m/s, which indicates an existing collision. 
  - **Time safety score:** 0 (Collision)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 0 (Collision)
