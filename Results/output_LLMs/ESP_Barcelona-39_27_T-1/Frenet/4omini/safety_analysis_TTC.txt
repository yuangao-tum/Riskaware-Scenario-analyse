### Safety analysis for timestep 3.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30805.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is relatively close at a longitudinal distance of 0.19 m and lateral distance of -8.84 m. This indicates a very close proximity, posing an immediate risk of collision.
   - **Distance safety score**: **1** (Extreme Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is -5.92 m/s longitudinally, indicating that the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle quickly. The minimal distance leads to a very short TTC.
   - **Time safety score**: **1** (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: **1** (Very high risk due to imminent collision)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30806.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 23.8 m and lateral distance is -42.9 m. Despite being in motion towards the ego vehicle, the distance is significantly larger, which suggests a lower immediate risk of collision.
   - **Distance safety score**: **4** (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is -5.96 m/s longitudinally and 1.92 m/s laterally. Given the distance, there is adequate time before a potential collision.
   - **Time safety score**: **4** (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: **4** (Manageable risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30807.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is at 0.0 m longitudinally and -8.9 m laterally. This suggests it is even with the rear section of the ego vehicle, which hints at a potential side collision.
   - **Distance safety score**: **1** (Extreme Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is -5.9 m/s longitudinally indicating an immediate risk of colliding with the side of the ego vehicle.
   - **Time safety score**: **1** (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: **1** (Very high risk due to imminent collision)

4. **Obstacle ID: 30808.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 0.08 m and lateral distance is -5.34 m, indicating a very close approach to the ego vehicle which poses a high risk of collision.
   - **Distance safety score**: **1** (Extreme Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity -5.92 m/s suggests the obstacle is closing in rapidly, leading to an extremely short TTC before potential impact.
   - **Time safety score**: **1** (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: **1** (Very high risk due to imminent collision)

5. **Obstacle ID: 30810.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The real distance is 0.0 m both longitudinally and laterally, indicating a direct overlap with the ego vehicle's position, resulting in an unavoidable collision.
   - **Distance safety score**: **0** (Collision)
   - **Time Risk reason**: With an exact overlap, collision is guaranteed without any time to avoid. 
   - **Time safety score**: **0** (Collision)
   - **Overall Risk score**: **0** (Collision)
