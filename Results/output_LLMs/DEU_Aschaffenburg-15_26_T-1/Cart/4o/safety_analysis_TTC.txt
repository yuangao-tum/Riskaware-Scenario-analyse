Safety analysis for the last timestep (7.0 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 7.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30441**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 30441 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (1999.0). The relative position indicates it is close with a very small lateral distance.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle has a relatively close proximity that would lead to a prompt collision if both maintain their paths. 
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30443**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 30443 is approaching on a nearby lanelet (1994.0) suggesting a moderate risk due to possible lateral encroachment.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Given its velocity angle, there's a moderate risk of future collision.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30446**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in a different lanelet with significant lateral distance from the ego vehicle; they are not on immediate collision courses.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's path and orientation indicate a low probability of intersecting with the ego vehicle's trajectory.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

All other obstacles are largely in separate or divergent paths compared to the ego vehicle due to significant longitudinal or lateral distances, orientations, or velocities, therefore, each would be considered at negligible risk or low risk for collision at this time step.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

No obstacles are currently at immediate collision or extreme risk levels. The above evaluations assume steady paths and velocities. Changes in vehicle dynamics would necessitate re-evaluation of these metrics.
