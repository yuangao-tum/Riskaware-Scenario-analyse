Safety analysis for the last timestep (7.0 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 7.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

* **TTC Calculation:**  Simplified TTC calculation is used due to lack of detailed trajectory information.  Longitudinal TTC (TTClong) is calculated based on the difference in longitudinal velocities and positions. Lateral TTC (TTClat) is similarly calculated using lateral components.  A more robust approach would involve predicting future trajectories and considering turning radii.
* **MDC Calculation:**  Euclidean distance is used as a proxy for MDC. A more accurate MDC would involve considering the shapes and orientations of the vehicles.
* **Risk Assessment Logic:** The risk scores are assigned based on approximate thresholds for TTC and MDC. Due to the simplified calculations, these scores are estimates.  The relative direction and lanelets information provide context but require further detailed analysis with proper mapping and lanelet connectivity information for a truly comprehensive assessment.

* **Missing Information:** Crucially, we lack information about lane boundaries, vehicle dimensions, and future trajectories. This limits the accuracy of the analysis.
