### Safety analysis for timestep 7.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30420.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: DTClong (-13.41 m) indicates the obstacle is behind the ego vehicle, and since it's moving away, the risk of collision is negligible.
  - Distance safety score: **5**
  - Time Risk reason: TTC is not applicable as the obstacle is not approaching the ego car.
  - Time safety score: **5**
  - Overall Risk score: **5**

- **Obstacle ID: 30422.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: DTClong (69.24 m) shows it's a safe distance away while moving away. Minimal risk is involved.
  - Distance safety score: **5**
  - Time Risk reason: TTC is positive due to the large distance and moving away, thus no risk of immediate collision.
  - Time safety score: **5**
  - Overall Risk score: **5**

- **Obstacle ID: 30423.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: DTClong (13.19 m) indicates this obstacle is quite close, and it's approaching the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: **2**
  - Time Risk reason: The obstacle is nearing, thus presenting a reasonable chance of collision in the near future. Assuming constant velocities, TTC can be calculated as `Distance / Relative Velocity`, which gives approximately 17.6 seconds. This suggests a maintainable situation.
  - Time safety score: **4**
  - Overall Risk score: **3**

- **Obstacle ID: 30424.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: DTClong (-20.82 m) indicates it's moving away, making it a safe distance.
  - Distance safety score: **5**
  - Time Risk reason: No risks involved as the distance is not decreasing.
  - Time safety score: **5**
  - Overall Risk score: **5**

- **Obstacle ID: 30425.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: DTClong (79.98 m) and lateral distance indicates no threat of collision.
  - Distance safety score: **5**
  - Time Risk reason: Moving away; no immediate threat detected.
  - Time safety score: **5**
  - Overall Risk score: **5**

- **Obstacle ID: 30426.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: DTClong (1.08 m) means it is very close, and it’s moving towards the ego car.
  - Distance safety score: **1**
  - Time Risk reason: TTC can be approximated; immediate collision risk is highly probable. Roughly 1.44 seconds until collision.
  - Time safety score: **1**
  - Overall Risk score: **1**

- **Obstacle ID: 30427.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: DTClong (20.66 m) indicates it is approaching, although not as closely.
  - Distance safety score: **2**
  - Time Risk reason: Approaching within a manageable timeframe, TTC gives a value of approximately 27.48 seconds.
  - Time safety score: **3**
  - Overall Risk score: **2**

- **Obstacle ID: 30428.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: DTClong (-19.09 m) means it isn't a risk as it's moving away.
  - Distance safety score: **5**
  - Time Risk reason: No risk of immediate collision.
  - Time safety score: **5**
  - Overall Risk score: **5**

- **Obstacle ID: 30430.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: DTClong (-28.32 m) indicates safety as it is also moving away.
  - Distance safety score: **5**
  - Time Risk reason: No risk of imminent collision.
  - Time safety score: **5**
  - Overall Risk score: **5**

- **Obstacle ID: 30431.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: DTClong (35.65 m) still demonstrates a safe distance; the obstacle is approaching but not close enough to worry.
  - Distance safety score: **4**
  - Time Risk reason: The distance and relative velocity allow for a comfortable reaction time; TTC would be significantly enough.
  - Time safety score: **4**
  - Overall Risk score: **4**

- **Obstacle ID: 30432.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: DTClong (39.71 m) indicates reasonable distance although it is approaching.
  - Distance safety score: **4**
  - Time Risk reason: With safe TTC, immediate collision risk is mitigated.
  - Time safety score: **4**
  - Overall Risk score: **4**

- **Obstacle ID: 30433.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: DTClong (44.45 m) indicates safety as compared to other closer obstacles.
  - Distance safety score: **4**
  - Time Risk reason: The obstacle is approaching but at a manageable distance providing time to react.
  - Time safety score: **4**
  - Overall Risk score: **4**

- **Obstacle ID: 30434.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: DTClong (49.24 m) indicates safety.
  - Distance safety score: **4**
  - Time Risk reason: Again, with good TTC, there is no immediate concern.
  - Time safety score: **4**
  - Overall Risk score: **4**

- **Obstacle ID: 30438.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: DTClong (17.55 m) indicates it is relatively close, but it's moving away.
  - Distance safety score: **4**
  - Time Risk reason: No immediate concern since it’s moving away.
  - Time safety score: **5**
  - Overall Risk score: **4**

- **Obstacle ID: 30440.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: DTClong (3.91 m) suggests a very close obstacle and is approaching.
