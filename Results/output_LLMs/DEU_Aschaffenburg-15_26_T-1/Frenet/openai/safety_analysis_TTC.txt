To evaluate the scenario based on the provided metrics, we will calculate the Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) for each obstacle relative to the ego vehicle.

### Assumptions for calculations:
- **Time to Collision (TTC)**:
  - Longitudinal TTC is calculated as: \( TTC_{long} = \frac{DTC_{long}}{V_{rel_{long}}} \)
  - Lateral TTC is calculated as: \( TTC_{lat} = \frac{DTC_{lat}}{V_{rel_{lat}}} \)
  - If the relative velocity in either longitudinal or lateral directions is zero and the distance is positive, TTC for that direction is treated as infinite.
  
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
  - The Minimum Distance to Collision is computed by considering the real distance in both longitudinal and lateral directions. The smallest Euclidean distance can be considered.
  - The formula: \( MDC = \sqrt{(DTC_{long})^2 + (DTC_{lat})^2} \)
