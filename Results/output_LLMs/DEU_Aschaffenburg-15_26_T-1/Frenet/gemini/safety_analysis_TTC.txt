### Safety analysis for timestep 7.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

It's important to note that the provided data lacks ego vehicle motion information.  This makes precise TTC calculations impossible. We will infer risk based on relative motion, distances, and the given explanations of motion.  Also, MDC is equivalent to current distance in this context due to the lack of ego motion data. We will therefore focus on distance and the *trends* implied by relative velocity and acceleration.

**General Assumptions for all obstacles:**
* **TTC Approximation:**  Since we don't have ego vehicle speed and acceleration, we will use a simplified TTC approximation.  If the relative velocity suggests the obstacle is getting closer *and* the distance is small, we will consider it a higher risk.  If the relative velocity suggests the obstacle is moving away, we will consider TTC to be less of a factor, focusing instead on the absolute distance.
*  A longitudinal distance under 3m is considered extremely dangerous given the likelihood of a collision, even with braking.
