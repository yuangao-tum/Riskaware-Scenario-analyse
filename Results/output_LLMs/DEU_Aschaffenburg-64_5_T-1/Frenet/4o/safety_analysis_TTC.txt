### Safety analysis for timestep 2.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30184.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance is 29.04 m, which is relatively safe. The obstacle is front-left and moving toward the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4
   - **Time Risk reason:** The negative longitudinal relative velocity suggests closing distance. The TTC for the front-left direction is moderate.
   - **Time safety score:** 3
   - **Overall Risk score:** 3

2. **Obstacle ID: 30185.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason:** With a longitudinal distance of 73.67 m, this obstacle poses a very low immediate risk due to its position in the front-right.
    - **Distance safety score:** 5
    - **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocity indicates a very slow approach. Time to collision is substantial.
    - **Time safety score:** 5
    - **Overall Risk score:** 5

3. **Obstacle ID: 30187.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason:** Extremely close at just 3.17 m in the front-left and closing in.
    - **Distance safety score:** 1
    - **Time Risk reason:** High risk as the velocity suggests quick closing distance.
    - **Time safety score:** 1
    - **Overall Risk score:** 1

4. **Obstacle ID: 30188.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason:** With 61.03 m, this obstacle is mid-range in the front-left and does not pose an immediate risk.
    - **Distance safety score:** 4
    - **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocity and distance indicate moderate time before potential collision.
    - **Time safety score:** 4
    - **Overall Risk score:** 4

5. **Obstacle ID: 30189.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason:** Located at 73.79 m in the front-right, minimal immediate threat.
    - **Distance safety score:** 5
    - **Time Risk reason:** Slow approach rate. There is ample time for actions to be taken.
    - **Time safety score:** 5
    - **Overall Risk score:** 5

6. **Obstacle ID: 30190.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason:** Even though coming from the front-left, at 69.93 m there is low immediate risk.
    - **Distance safety score:** 4
    - **Time Risk reason:** Approach rate is moderate. There is adequate time for prevention actions.
    - **Time safety score:** 4
    - **Overall Risk score:** 4

7. **Obstacle ID: 30191.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason:** Located 55.31 m in the front-left. Presents a moderate risk.
    - **Distance safety score:** 3
    - **Time Risk reason:** Fast approaching, reducing TTC. Needs monitoring.
    - **Time safety score:** 3
    - **Overall Risk score:** 3

    - **Distance Risk reason:** With 53.15 m, in the front-left with moderate risk due to position.
    - **Distance safety score:** 3
    - **Time Risk reason:** Moderate approach speed. TTC indicates timely reactions are necessary.
    - **Time safety score:** 3
    - **Overall Risk score:** 3

9. **Obstacle ID: 30193.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason:** 37.98 m ahead and moving slightly away laterally. Moderate risk.
    - **Distance safety score:** 3
    - **Time Risk reason:** Slow closing movement. More time for evasive actions.
    - **Time safety score:** 3
    - **Overall Risk score:** 3

10. **Obstacle ID: 30195.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason:** Direct collision risk without any distance (both longitudinal and lateral at 0.0 m).
    - **Distance safety score:** 0
    - **Time Risk reason:** Immediate collision scenario.
    - **Time safety score:** 0
    - **Overall Risk score:** 0
