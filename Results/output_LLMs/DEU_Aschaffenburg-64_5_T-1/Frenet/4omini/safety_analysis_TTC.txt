### Safety analysis for timestep 2.3: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 30184.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 29.04 m longitudinally and 7.45 m laterally ahead of the ego vehicle, indicating it is in the path but at a considerable distance.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk) 
  - Time Risk reason: TTC is calculated as \( TTC = \frac{29.04 \, \text{m}}{15.5 \, \text{m/s}} \approx 1.87 \, \text{s} \), indicating a manageable risk if timely reactions are implemented.
  - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30185.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: At a distance of 73.67 m longitudinally and -1.64 m laterally, it poses negligible risk to a direct collision.
  - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: With a relative velocity of -6.92 m/s, \( TTC \approx 10.64 \, \text{s} \), indicating ample time to react.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30187.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is very close at 3.17 m longitudinally and laterally 1.89 m, indicating a high concern for collision.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC is approximately \( \frac{3.17 \, \text{m}}{15.96 \, \text{m/s}} \approx 0.20 \, \text{s} \), indicating an immediate collision risk.
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30188.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is distant at 61.03 m longitudinally and laterally 3.94 m, posing little risk.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The TTC calculation gives \( TTC \approx 8.81 \, \text{s} \), indicating there is significant time to react.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30189.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is at a distance of 73.79 m longitudinally and -9.2 m laterally, suggesting a negligible risk of colliding.
  - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: With a TTC of roughly \( TTC \approx 10.65 \, \text{s} \), this allows sufficient reaction time.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30190.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: 69.93 m longitudinally and 33.73 m laterally places this obstacle at a safe distance.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: \( TTC \approx 10.16 \, \text{s} \) allows for ample reaction time.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30191.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The distance of 55.31 m longitudinally and 7.44 m laterally places it at a manageable distance.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: \( TTC \approx 3.88 \, \text{s} \), indicating manageable risk.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30192.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The distance of 53.15 m longitudinally and laterally 3.92 m suggests a low collision risk.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: \( TTC \approx 8.15 \, \text{s} \), indicating considerable time for the ego vehicle to react.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30193.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: At 37.98 m longitudinal and lateral 3.86 m, this indicates a controllable situation.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: With a calculated \( TTC \approx 24.38 \, \text{s} \), there's ample reaction time.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30195.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal and lateral distances are both 0.0 m, indicating an exact collision.
  - Distance safety score: 0 (Collision)
  - Time Risk reason: As the distances are 0, the collision is imminent.
  - Time safety score: 0 (Collision)
  - Overall Risk score: 0
