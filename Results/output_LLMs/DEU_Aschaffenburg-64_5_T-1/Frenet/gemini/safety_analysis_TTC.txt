### Safety analysis for timestep 2.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30184.0
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Located 29.04m longitudinally and 7.45m laterally in the front-left.  While not immediately close, the closing longitudinal velocity (-15.5 m/s) suggests a rapidly decreasing distance.
- **Distance safety score:** 3
- **Time Risk reason:**  TTClong is approximately 1.87 seconds (29.04m / 15.5m/s). This represents a high risk due to the fast-approaching speed.
- **Time safety score:** 2
- **Overall Risk score:** 2

- **Obstacle ID:** 30185.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located far ahead longitudinally (73.67m) and slightly to the right (-1.64m).  Presents minimal risk at the current distance.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:**  TTClong is approximately 10.64 seconds.  Poses no immediate threat.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30187.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Extremely close, both longitudinally (3.17m) and laterally (1.89m), in the front-left.  High risk of imminent collision.
- **Distance safety score:** 1
- **Time Risk reason:**  TTClong is approximately 0.2 seconds. Extremely high risk of collision.
- **Time safety score:** 1
- **Overall Risk score:** 1

- **Obstacle ID:** 30188.0
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Located far ahead longitudinally (61.03m) and slightly to the left (3.94m).  Presents low risk at the current distance.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:**  TTClong is approximately 8.82 seconds.  Poses no immediate threat.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30189.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located far ahead longitudinally (73.79m) and to the right (-9.2m).  Presents low risk at the current distance.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** TTClong is approximately 10.66 seconds. Poses no immediate threat.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30190.0
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Relatively far (69.93m longitudinally and 33.73m laterally). The lateral closing speed (-8.43 m/s) is a concern.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** TTClong is approximately 10.15 seconds, posing little longitudinal risk. However, the lateral motion needs monitoring.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30191.0
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Moderately far longitudinally (55.31m) and not very far laterally (7.44m) in the front-left.  The closing longitudinal velocity warrants attention.
- **Distance safety score:** 3
- **Time Risk reason:** TTClong is about 3.89 seconds. The approaching speed presents a medium risk.
- **Time safety score:** 3
- **Overall Risk score:** 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 30192.0
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Located moderately far (53.15m longitudinally and 3.92m laterally). The longitudinal closing velocity requires monitoring.
- **Distance safety score:** 3
- **Time Risk reason:** TTClong is approximately 8.14 seconds. Poses no immediate threat.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30193.0
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Moderately close longitudinally (37.98m) and laterally close (3.86m). The slow closing speed (-1.56m/s) lessens the risk slightly.
- **Distance safety score:** 3
- **Time Risk reason:** TTClong is approximately 24.35 seconds which is not concerning.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30195.0
- **Distance Risk reason:**  In collision (0m longitudinal and lateral distance).
- **Distance safety score:** 0
- **Time Risk reason:**  Already collided (TTC is undefined or 0).
- **Time safety score:** 0
- **Overall Risk score:** 0
