Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.3 seconds):
To analyze the collision risks in the provided scenario, we'll follow the outlined steps to assess each obstacle's position relative to the ego vehicle.

### Metrics Calculations:
1. **Identify Obstacles**: The ego vehicle and its obstacles need to be examined for their positions, lanelets, velocities, and accelerations.
2. **Calculate TTC and MDC**: We'll estimate both Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) based on the provided positions and velocities, focused notably on the longitudinal and lateral movements.

### Safety analysis for timestep: 2.3 seconds
Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30184.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: DTClong ≈ 67.15m (longitudinal distance calculation) indicates the ego vehicle is moving towards the obstacle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC ≈ 5.27 seconds (based on longitudinal speed differences), which is moderate time before potential impact.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30185.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: DTClong is significant over 100m, so no immediate lateral or longitudinal threat.

  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30189.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Highly negligible lateral separation.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC far exceeds 10 seconds; complete safety.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30190.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Approaching from the front but with significant separation.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC is around 6.58 seconds which translates to moderate caution area.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30191.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Less than 50m represents a significant concern.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC is about 3.65 seconds, close time window but manageable.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30192.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance is quite far out.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC well around 15 seconds implies the ego vehicle is well clear.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30193.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Significant DTClong and is on the verge of lanelets.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

### Conclusion:
Overall, there are no immediate collision threats identified (Overall Risk Score 0). There are no obstacles at extreme risk for a collision, as the highest scored risk is categorized under High Risk (Obstacle ID: 30195.0) with a score of 2, signifying a need for alertness but not an immediate concern.
