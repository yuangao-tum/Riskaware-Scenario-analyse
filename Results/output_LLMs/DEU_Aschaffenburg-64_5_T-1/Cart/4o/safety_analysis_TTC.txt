Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

To begin the analysis, the first step is to identify the obstacles in the same lanelet or trajectory as the ego vehicle (lanelet 176.0). The relevant obstacles from the scenario description are 30184.0, 30188.0, 30192.0, 30193.0, and 30195.0. These are primarily in close proximity or on a potential collision course and will be prioritized in the analysis.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30184.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle is in lanelet 177.0 and is not directly in the same trajectory as the ego vehicle, but proximity suggests monitoring. Distance to the ego vehicle is relatively modest but without direct intersection.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Obstacle is moving with a speed greater than the ego vehicle, headed away slightly; potential risk if trajectories converge later. No immediate threat.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30185.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Stationary obstacle with zero velocity, located in lanelet 182.0, distant from the ego vehicle path.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: No motion implies no time-based collision course is possible.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30187.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle in lanelet 177.0, moving at a reasonable speed but not in immediate close proximity.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Speed suggests divergence from ego trajectory, but careful monitoring advised if trajectory paths modify.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30188.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Stationary obstacle in lanelet 176.0; could be along the same future trajectory, but currently maintains safe distance.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: No motion minimizes imminent risk; enough time to navigate around.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30189.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Almost stationary, distant from the trajectory of the ego vehicle, located in lanelet 182.0.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Minimal speed implies negligible risk.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30190.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned in lanelet 180.0, not directly affecting ego vehicle.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Fast enough but on an irrelevant path direction wise to cause concern.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30191.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle in lanelet 177.0, maintaining adequate clearance from the ego trajectory.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Maintains speed, but not pointed towards the ego vehicle. Equivalent scenario of low spatial interaction potential.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30192.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Very close in lanelet 176.0 to the ego vehicle, but moderate velocity has reduced immediate risk.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Increasing relative speed, but direction-wise mitigation aids the risk reduction measure.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30193.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Closing distance, modest deceleration in lanelet 176.0 worthy of strict monitoring.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Maintains significant deceleration, yet could close in on the ego vehicle if trajectories align.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30195.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Fast-moving, same lanelet 176.0, proximally close but not indicative of immediate inclement intrusion.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Decreasing velocity moderates collision time threat but remains a visible obstacle.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

### Summary in JSON Format:
The scenario indicates medium risk levels requiring standard monitoring and response adjustments, but no immediate collisions or extreme threats.
