Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

* **TTC Calculation:**  I'm assuming a simplified TTC calculation based on current velocities and positions.  A more sophisticated analysis would involve predicting future trajectories, accounting for accelerations, and considering the shape and size of the vehicles.  Specifically, TTClong will be positive if the obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and negative if behind. TTClat will be calculated based on the lateral distance and the difference in the lateral velocities.
* **MDC Calculation:** This analysis uses Euclidean distance between the ego vehicle and obstacles as a proxy for MDC.  In a real-world scenario, MDC would be calculated based on the closest distance between the vehicle outlines throughout their predicted paths.
* **Lanelet Context:**  The lanelet information is crucial for determining risk.  Obstacles in different lanelets pose less immediate risk unless their trajectories intersect with the ego vehicle's path.


### Obstacle Analysis:
