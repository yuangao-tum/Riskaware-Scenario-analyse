### Safety analysis for timestep 4.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30784.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal and lateral distances are both 0.0 m, indicating the obstacle is in direct collision with the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 0
- **Time Risk reason**: Since the obstacle is in direct collision, the TTC is effectively 0 seconds.
- **Time safety score**: 0
- **Overall Risk score**: 0

#### Obstacle ID: 30785.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 18.54 m and lateral distance is 56.55 m, with a trajectory moving towards the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's relative velocity indicates it's moving towards the ego car with a negative relative velocity, indicating a potential future collision without changes.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30786.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is laterally 2.07 m to the left but with no longitudinal distance change, indicating proximity which requires attention.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: No significant longitudinal movement indicates low immediate threat of collision.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30787.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: With a lateral distance of 5.57 m and no longitudinal distance change, the obstacle is relatively safe, but in close proximity.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: No relative motion changes are detected longitudinally, presenting low collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30789.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: At a longitudinal distance of -12.37 m, this obstacle is behind but moving towards the ego vehicle. 
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is minor but in a direction that decreases the gap over time, requiring monitoring.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 3
