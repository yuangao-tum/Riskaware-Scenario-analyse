### Safety analysis for timestep 4.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30784.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance (DTClong) is 0.0 m and lateral distance (DTClat) is also 0.0 m, indicating that the ego vehicle is in direct contact with this obstacle.
  - **Distance safety score:** 0 (Collision)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Since the distance is already 0.0 m in both longitudinal and lateral directions, there is an immediate collision. Therefore, the time to collision is effectively 0 seconds.
  - **Time safety score:** 0 (Collision)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 0 (Collision)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30785.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance is 18.54 m and lateral distance is 56.55 m, which poses a low risk of immediate collision.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocities are longitudinal -2.75 m/s (moving towards) and lateral -3.06 m/s. The calculations yield a TTC in the lateral direction of 18.54 / 3.06 = 6.07 seconds, and in the longitudinal direction of 18.54 / 2.75 = 6.74 seconds. Both TTCs indicate that the risk of collision is manageable.
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30786.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance is 0.0 m and lateral distance is 2.07 m, indicating the ego vehicle is on a direct collision path with the obstacle.
  - **Distance safety score:** 0 (Collision)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance to collision is again 0.0 m, hence the time to collision is 0 seconds.
  - **Time safety score:** 0 (Collision)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 0 (Collision)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30787.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance is 0.0 m and lateral distance is 5.57 m, resulting in a direct collision course.
  - **Distance safety score:** 0 (Collision)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Since the longitudinal distance is 0.0 m, the time to collision is effectively 0 seconds.
  - **Time safety score:** 0 (Collision)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 0 (Collision)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30789.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance is -12.37 m (indicating the ego vehicle is behind this obstacle) and the lateral distance is 0.0 m; hence no immediate risk of a collision.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is driving toward the ego vehicle at a relative velocity of 0.87 m/s. Considering the distance of 12.37 m, the TTC would be 12.37 / 0.87 â‰ˆ 14.21 seconds. This indicates sufficient time to react.
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30784.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    }
}
```

### Conclusion:
The analysis results indicate that there are multiple obstacles classified under the collision category. Immediate action is required to prevent collisions with obstacles 30784.0, 30786.0, and 30787.0, as they are directly colliding with the ego vehicle. Other obstacles presented lower risk and can be managed with adequate response time.
