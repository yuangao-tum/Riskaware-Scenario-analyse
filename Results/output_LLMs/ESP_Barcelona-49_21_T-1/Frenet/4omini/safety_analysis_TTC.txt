### Safety analysis for timestep 4.3: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30784.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance is 0.0 m, indicating the obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, posing an imminent collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 0 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** With a relative longitudinal velocity of -2.85 m/s and a direct alignment with the ego vehicle, TTC is 0 seconds. Immediate collision is imminent.
  - **Time safety score:** 0 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 0 (Extreme Risk)

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 30785.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is 18.54 m longitudinally and 56.55 m laterally away, mitigating immediate collision risk but with a potential threat as it moves toward the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The longitudinal TTC is calculated as 18.54 m / 2.75 m/s ≈ 6.73 seconds providing enough reaction time and the lateral movement does not pose immediate danger.
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 30786.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is 0.0 m longitudinally and 2.07 m laterally, with exact longitudinal alignment. This indicates an imminent collision hazard.
  - **Distance safety score:** 0 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The longitudinal TTC is 0 seconds due to the 0.0 m distance, suggesting an impact is unavoidable without immediate action.
  - **Time safety score:** 0 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 0 (Extreme Risk)

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 30787.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Similarly, the obstacle has a longitudinal distance of 0.0 m and a lateral distance of 5.57 m, indicating that it poses an imminent collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 0 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The TTC is again calculated as 0 seconds due to the 0.0 m distance, indicating an unavoidable collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 0 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 0 (Extreme Risk)

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 30789.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance is -12.37 m (behind) and 0.0 m laterally, indicating that this obstacle is currently moving towards the ego vehicle but poses a lesser risk as it's coming from behind.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The TTC can be calculated as -12.37 m / 0.87 m/s ≈ -14.19 seconds, indicating that this obstacle is present but not an immediate threat.
  - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
