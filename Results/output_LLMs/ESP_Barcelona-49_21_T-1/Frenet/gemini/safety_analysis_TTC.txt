### Safety analysis for timestep 4.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30784.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in direct collision with the ego vehicle (DTClong = 0.0m, DTClat = 0.0m).
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Already in collision, TTC is effectively zero.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 30785.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at a safe longitudinal and lateral distance (18.54m and 56.55m respectively).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle, the relative velocities and distances suggest ample time to react.  A precise TTC calculation isn't possible without more data, but given the distances, it's likely >5 seconds.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30786.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is very close laterally (2.07m) while longitudinally aligned (0.0m). This indicates a high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  The small lateral distance and the fact that they are longitudinally aligned implies a very short time to collision if lateral movement continues.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30787.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Laterally close (5.57m) and longitudinally aligned (0.0m), presenting a significant risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Similar to 30786, the relatively small lateral distance and longitudinal alignment suggest a short TTC.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30789.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle at a safe distance (-12.37m longitudinally).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Although the obstacle is approaching from behind, the relative velocity and distance suggest no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
