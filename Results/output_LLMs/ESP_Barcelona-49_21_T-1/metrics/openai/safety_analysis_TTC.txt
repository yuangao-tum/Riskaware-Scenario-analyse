Safety analysis for timestep 4.3 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30784
- Relative Direction: Collision
- Distance Risk Reason: Both longitudinal and lateral distances to collision are 0.0, indicating an immediate collision risk from the obstruction, hence the risk is extreme.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 0
- Time Risk Reason: Both longitudinal and lateral times to collision are 0.0, indicating an immediate collision risk that mirrors the distance metrics.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Risk Score: 0

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30785
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: The longitudinal distance of 18.54 and lateral distance of 56.55 suggest a low risk, as both distances are well above critical thresholds.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5 (rounded down to 4)
- Time Risk Reason: The longitudinal time to collision of 6.74 and lateral time to collision of 18.46 indicates low risk with sufficient time to react.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5 (rounded down to 4)
- Overall Risk Score: 4

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30786
- Relative Direction: Left
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance is 0.0 and lateral distance is 2.07, thus indicating an immediate lateral severe risk of collision.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.5 (rounded down to 1)
- Time Risk Reason: The longitudinal time to collision is 0.0 and lateral time to collision is infinity, which indicates an immediate collision risk with no impending lateral movement.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 2.5 (rounded down to 2)
- Overall Risk Score: 1

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30787
- Relative Direction: Left
- Distance Risk Reason: With a longitudinal distance of 0.0 and a lateral distance of 5.57, there is also an immediate severe lateral collision risk.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 2 (rounded down)
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal time to collision of 0.0 and lateral time of infinity results in an immediate risk of collision.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 2.5 (rounded down to 2)
- Overall Risk Score: 1

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30789
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: A longitudinal distance of 12.37 and lateral distance of 0.0 indicate a somewhat manageable situation as there's no immediate risk.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 2
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal time of 14.23 and lateral time of 0.0 suggest that while there's enough time longitudinally, the lateral component is at risk of collision.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 2
- Overall Risk Score: 2
