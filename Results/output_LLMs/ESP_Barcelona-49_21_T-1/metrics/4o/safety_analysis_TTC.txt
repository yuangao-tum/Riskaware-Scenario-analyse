- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 0
- **Time Risk Reason:** Collision imminent as time to collision is 0.0 for both longitudinal and lateral dimensions.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Risk Score: 0

#### Obstacle 30785:
- Obstacle ID: 30785
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Minimal risk due to large longitudinal (18.54) and lateral (56.55) distances.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
- **Time Risk Reason:** Negligible risk due to large longitudinal (6.74) and lateral (18.46) times to collision.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Risk Score: 5

#### Obstacle 30786:
- Obstacle ID: 30786
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Medium risk due to lateral distance of 2.07 on the left. Longitudinal alignment is exact (0.0 distance).
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 3
- **Time Risk Reason:** High risk due to exact longitudinal alignment (0.0 time) but no lateral motion.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5 (since lateral time is infinity)
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Risk Score: 4

#### Obstacle 30787:
- Obstacle ID: 30787
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Low risk due to lateral distance of 5.57 on the left. Longitudinal alignment is exact (0.0 distance).
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4
- **Time Risk Reason:** High risk due to exact longitudinal alignment (0.0 time) but no lateral motion.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5 (since lateral time is infinity)
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Risk Score: 4

#### Obstacle 30789:
- Obstacle ID: 30789
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Medium risk due to substantial longitudinal distance (12.37) behind.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
- **Time Risk Reason:** Low risk due to substantial time to collision from behind (14.23).
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Risk Score: 5
