Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.3: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30784.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (3814.0) and is stationary with a current distance of approximately 4.0 meters (calculated using Euclidean distance formula: √((138.5304 - 135.3298)² + (-222.6073 + 219.4417)²)). Given that it is stationary and very close to the ego vehicle, there is a significant distance risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary, leading to an immediate or very short TTC. TTClong is very low due to zero velocity, indicating an extreme time risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30785.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is not in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is approximately 62.48 meters away in a different lanelet (2036.0), moving perpendicular. Thus, it poses negligible distance risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: With the obstacle moving laterally away in a different lanelet, the TTClat and TTClong are not relevant for collision risks in this context. Hence, there is negligible time risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30786.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is stationary and approximately 7.1 meters away from the ego vehicle, located in an adjacent lanelet (3813.0). While there is some proximity, the distance provides minimal collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Due to the stationary nature and position in an adjacent lanelet, the obstacle poses a low time risk unless the ego changes lanes.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30787.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This stationary obstacle is about 9.7 meters from the ego vehicle and located in another lanelet (3812.0), creating minimal collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: As a non-moving obstacle in a different lanelet, it presents low time risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30789.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This moving obstacle is approximately 17.5 meters away in lanelet 1370.0 and moving away from the ego vehicle's path.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Since the obstacle is moving in the opposite direction and is already at a safe distance, time risk is low.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)
