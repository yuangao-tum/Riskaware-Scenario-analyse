Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30784.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet (3814) as the ego vehicle and very close.  Precise distance calculations are needed, but the proximity suggests high risk.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary and the ego vehicle is moving towards it.  TTC will be very low.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30785.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (2036) and poses no immediate threat based on the provided positions.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Lateral movement of this obstacle isn't specified, and assuming it stays in its lane, TTC is not a concern.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30786.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (3813) but relatively close. Requires further investigation of lateral separation to confirm.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary. Risk depends on the ego vehicle's lateral movement.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30787.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (3812). Similar to 30786, lateral separation is key to determining risk. 
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Stationary obstacle. Risk assessment depends on the ego vehicle's trajectory.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30789.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (1370) and positioned further behind.  Unlikely to pose a risk based on current information.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Though this obstacle is moving, the different lanelet and position suggest low risk.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
