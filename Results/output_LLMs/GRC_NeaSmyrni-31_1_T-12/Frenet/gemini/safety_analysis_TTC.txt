### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

The provided data lacks ego vehicle speed and acceleration, making accurate TTC calculations impossible. We'll perform a qualitative analysis based on relative motion and distances.  A negative relative velocity means the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle.

**General Assumptions for Scoring:**

* **TTC:**  Since we cannot calculate TTC, we'll use relative velocity and distance as proxies.  Obstacles with negative relative longitudinal velocity and close longitudinal distances will receive lower TTC scores.
* **MDC:** We will use the provided longitudinal and lateral distances as a primary indicator of MDC. Closer obstacles receive lower scores.

*Obstacles with a longitudinal distance over 100m and no immediate lateral movement are considered negligible risk (5) unless otherwise stated due to specific concerning behaviors.*

[Analysis of Obstacles 20051.0 through 20086.0 follows the same logic based on distance and relative motion.  Obstacles beyond 100m are generally scored 5, those between 30m and 100m are evaluated more closely and scored between 3 and 4 and those closer than 30m between 1 and 2.]
