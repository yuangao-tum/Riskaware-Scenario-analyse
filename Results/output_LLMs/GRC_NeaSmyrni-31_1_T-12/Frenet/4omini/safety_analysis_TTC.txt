### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 20024.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = 122.54 m, DTClat = -21.47 m. This indicates a moderate distance in the longitudinal direction while being to the right laterally.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Vrel_long = -2.38 m/s. TTC = 122.54 m / 2.38 m/s = 51.4 seconds (Longitudinal direction).
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 20026.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = 78.23 m, DTClat = -27.83 m. Close longitudinally but negative lateral distance indicates a right-side overlap.
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Vrel_long = -6.09 m/s. TTC = 78.23 m / 6.09 m/s = 12.85 seconds.
   - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 20038.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = 133.37 m and DTClat = -3.41 m, moderate longitudinal distance, slightly to the right.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Vrel_long = -2.38 m/s. TTC = 133.37 m / 2.38 m/s = 56.0 seconds (Longitudinal direction).
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 20039.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = 86.46 m and DTClat = -25.54 m, indicating proximity with concern for lateral movement towards right.
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Vrel_long = -4.56 m/s. TTC = 86.46 m / 4.56 m/s = 18.98 seconds.
   - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 20041.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = 124.98 m, DTClat = -10.55 m. An adequate longitudinal gap and moderate lateral offset.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Vrel_long = -3.17 m/s. TTC = 124.98 m / 3.17 m/s = 39.39 seconds.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID: 20042.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = 129.76 m, DTClat = -9.46 m. This represents a good distance longitudinally and laterally.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Vrel_long = -2.38 m/s. TTC = 129.76 m / 2.38 m/s = 54.40 seconds.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

7. **Obstacle ID: 20045.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = 125.09 m and DTClat = -36.34 m, showing a significant distance longitudinally but close laterally.
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Vrel_long = -2.41 m/s. TTC = 125.09 m / 2.41 m/s = 51.91 seconds.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

8. **Obstacle ID: 20046.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = 126.09 m and DTClat = -15.43 m. The distances suggest safety but a lateral concern.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Vrel_long = -2.38 m/s. TTC = 126.09 m / 2.38 m/s = 52.9 seconds.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

9. **Obstacle ID: 20056.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = 84.98 m and DTClat = -60.85 m, indicating relative proximity.
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Vrel_long = -2.38 m/s. TTC = 84.98 m / 2.38 m/s = 35.69 seconds.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

10. **Obstacle ID: 20084.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = 0.0 m and DTClat = 0.0 m means the vehicles are in direct collision.
    - Distance safety score: 0 (Collision)
    - Time Risk reason: Direct impact occurring; thus, TTC = 0 seconds.
    - Time safety score: 0 (Collision)
    - Overall Risk score: 0 (Collision)
