7. **Obstacle ID: 20045.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Extremely slow speed, different path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: No risk due to minimal speed and distinct lanelet.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

8. **Obstacle ID: 20046.0 to 20054.0**
   - **Distance and Time Risk reason**: Stationary and different trajectory or velocities (~0).
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 each
   - **Time safety score**: 5 each
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 each

9. **Obstacle ID: 20056.0 to 20060.0**
   - **Distance and Time Risk reason**: Very low velocities or stationary; off current path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 each
   - **Time safety score**: 5 each
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 each

10. **Obstacle ID: 20061.0 to 20080.0**
    - **Distance and Time Risk reason**: Many stationary with unrelated direction.
    - **Distance safety score**: 5 each
    - **Time safety score**: 5 each
    - **Overall Risk score**: 5 each

11. **Obstacle ID: 20082.0 to 20086.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: All located in same lanelet yet moving away in different directions.
    - **Distance safety score**: 4 each 
    - **Time Risk reason**: Different but parallel or diverging paths, maintaining safety.
    - **Time safety score**: 4 each 
    - **Overall Risk score**: 4 each 

### Summary in JSON Format: 
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

All obstacles either pose negligible or low (the worst being low) collision risks as they are predominantly stationary or situated in differing lanelets with divergent trajectories relative to the ego vehicle, thus not requiring urgent maneuvers. There are no collision or extreme risk obstacles in the provided scenario.
