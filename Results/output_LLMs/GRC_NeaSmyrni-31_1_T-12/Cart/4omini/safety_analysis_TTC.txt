Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.6 seconds):
To analyze the potential collisions involving the ego vehicle and the identified obstacles, we first need to review the positions, velocities, and orientations. The ego vehicle is at coordinates (49.3216, 79.4487) with a velocity of 2.3769 and a negative acceleration indicating it is slowing down. We will process each obstacle to determine the Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) based on the trajectory of the ego vehicle.

### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 20024.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary and located at (-19.0582, -30.0869). The distance to the ego vehicle is approximately 70.57 units, which is significantly far.
   - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Since it is stationary and far enough, there is no possibility of collision.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 20026.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away at a speed of 4.1445, located at (-8.5981, 13.442). The distance is about 58.71 units, enough to indicate safety.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: This obstacle is on a non-collision course as it is moving at some speed away. 
   - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 20038.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary (-6.2769, -46.8173) and at a distance of approximately 73.29 units. Safe distance.
   - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: No movement means no collision risk.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 5

4. **Obstacle ID: 20039.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle travels towards the ego vehicle at 2.2359 and is at 63.43 units away. It is a potential risk.
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Moving towards the ego with relative velocity suggests this could develop into a collision course.
   - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 3

5. **Obstacle ID: 20041.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Positioned at (-9.8115, -36.3919) and 66.49 units away, suggesting safe distance.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The obstacle is also moving towards the ego vehicle at 1.514 but is far enough.
   - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4

6. **Obstacle ID: 20042.0** 
   - Distance Risk reason: Located at (-10.5646, -41.2318) with no movement and at 67.43 units away. Safe.
   - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Stationary obstacle means no risk of collision.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 5

7. **Obstacle ID: 20060.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Its position (-0.9059, -50.4091) and speed indicates danger approaching from below, around 50.01 units away.
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Moving towards the ego at high speed, this could become a collision risk rapidly.
   - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 3

8. **Obstacle ID: 20084.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Positioned at (50.8476, 83.5148) with a speed of 7.2707 and moving away suggests no collision risk but close proximity (1.67 units).
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Being moved away at a considerable speed reduces its risk of collision.
   - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4

### Conclusion
- All analyzed obstacles have been reviewed, and none pose an immediate collision risk; thus, no collisions (0 Risk Score) were identified.
- The overall risks are mitigated by the distances and speed differentials of obstacles to the ego vehicle. There are threats labeled with a medium risk (3) but do not pose an immediate danger without successful mitigation strategies employed.
