Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.6 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* **DTC (Distance to Collision):**  Since the provided scenario lacks precise information on obstacle dimensions and shapes, DTC calculations will be based on center-to-center distances.  This is a simplification. A more accurate analysis would involve object bounding boxes and more sophisticated distance calculations.
* **TTC (Time to Collision):** TTC calculations also rely on the relative velocities between the ego vehicle and the obstacles.  We assume constant velocity for a short prediction horizon, understanding that this is a limitation in real-world scenarios.
* **Lanelet Information:**  Lanelet information is crucial for accurate risk assessment.  We will rely heavily on this to understand potential conflicts.  We'll assume lane changes are not instantaneous and require time.
* **Overall Risk Score:** This score aggregates distance and time risk, with a bias towards the more immediate danger.  If TTC is very low, even if the distance is not critically small, the overall risk will be high.

### Obstacle Analysis:

Since the data provided only includes position, orientation, velocity, and acceleration, a precise TTC and MDC calculation is impossible.  The analysis below provides an *estimation* of the risk based on distance and lanelets assuming a limited prediction horizon and constant velocity.

* **Methodology for Risk Estimation:**
    1. **Same Lanelet:** Obstacles in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle are immediately flagged as potential hazards, especially those ahead of the ego vehicle.
    2. **Nearby Lanelets:** Obstacles in adjacent lanelets are considered if they are close to the ego vehicle and their motion suggests a potential lane change conflict.
    3. **Distance:**  Large distances between the ego vehicle and obstacle generally lead to lower risk scores, unless combined with very high closing speeds.
    4. **Velocity Difference:**  Large closing velocities significantly increase the risk, even at moderate distances.

    - Time Risk reason: Potential for collision given the closing velocity, but more time available than with closer obstacles.
    - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)


* **Obstacle ID: 20082**
    - Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet and ahead of ego vehicle.  Closing velocity is a concern.
    - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: Moderate risk of collision.  The closing velocity is a significant factor.
    - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)


* **Obstacle ID: 20084**
   - Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet and ahead of ego vehicle, but at a greater distance. High closing velocity.
    - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: The significant closing speed makes this a medium risk despite the greater distance.
    - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

* **Obstacle ID: 20086**
    - Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet and ahead of ego vehicle, and farthest away. Very high closing velocity.
    - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
    - Time Risk reason:  The high closing velocity increases risk, despite the larger distance.
    - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

* **All other obstacles:**  These are in different lanelets and are assessed as 4 (Low risk) or 5 (Negligible Risk), primarily due to their distance from the ego vehicle and current trajectories.  However, continuous monitoring is essential, as their future motion could create potential hazards.
