### Safety analysis for timestep 5.7 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### - Obstacle ID: 30730.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is at a longitudinal distance of 0.2 m and a lateral distance of 0.0 m, indicating it is directly in front of the ego vehicle. This poses an immediate risk of a collision.
- **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is -3.78 m/s (meaning the obstacle is approaching quickly), and with a longitudinal distance of 0.2 m, the Time to Collision (TTC) can be calculated as:
  \[
  TTC = \frac{DTClong}{|Vrel\_long|} = \frac{0.2 \, m}{3.78 \, m/s} \approx 0.0526 \, s
  \]
   This indicates an imminent collision, which is extremely dangerous.
- **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### - Obstacle ID: 30731.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is 39.12 m longitudinally and -92.24 m laterally positioned at a considerable distance from the ego vehicle. However, it is approaching the ego vehicle from the front-right.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative longitudinal velocity is -2.69 m/s. The TTC computes as:
  \[
  TTC = \frac{39.12 \, m}{2.69 \, m/s} \approx 14.55 \, s
  \]
  Given this distance and the relatively low closing speed, the likelihood of collision is negligible.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### - Obstacle ID: 30733.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is at 0.17 m longitudinally and -5.39 m laterally. Its very close longitudinal distance to the ego vehicle presents a significant risk of collision.
- **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: With a longitudinal velocity of -3.78 m/s:
  \[
  TTC = \frac{0.17 \, m}{3.78 \, m/s} \approx 0.0449 \, s
  \]
  This short TTC highlights the critical risk of impending collision.
- **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### - Obstacle ID: 30734.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is longitudinally 44.26 m and -20.0 m away. While not directly threatening the ego vehicle, it is coming from the front-right which could lead to potential conflict depending on the ego vehicleâ€™s trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is -4.3 m/s. The TTC is calculated as:
  \[
  TTC = \frac{44.26 \, m}{4.3 \, m/s} \approx 10.28 \, s
  \]
  This TTC allows for time to react and adjust maneuvering safely.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30730.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

### Conclusion:
In this scenario, Obstacle IDs 30730.0 and 30733.0 present immediate risks of collision (Extreme Risk), while the remaining obstacles pose relatively low risks of collision, with sufficient distance and time to react safely.
