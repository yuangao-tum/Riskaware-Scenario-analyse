### Safety analysis for timestep 5.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30730.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is extremely close longitudinally (0.2m) and directly in front of the ego vehicle.  This indicates an extremely high risk of immediate collision.
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The negative longitudinal relative velocity (-3.78 m/s) indicates the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle. Combined with the very small longitudinal distance, TTC is virtually zero.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30731.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is relatively far longitudinally (39.12m) and laterally (-92.24m). The lateral distance and the fact it's to the right reduces the immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle is approaching both longitudinally and laterally, the distances are significant enough to provide ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30733.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is extremely close longitudinally (0.17m) and moderately close laterally (-5.39m) to the front-right of the ego vehicle.  This presents a very high risk of immediate collision.
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The negative longitudinal relative velocity (-3.78 m/s) indicates the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle.  The small longitudinal distance implies a near-zero TTC. Although there's no lateral relative motion, the longitudinal risk dominates.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30734.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  The obstacle is at a safe longitudinal distance (44.26m), and a moderate lateral distance (-20.0m) to the front-right.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Although the obstacle is approaching both longitudinally and laterally, the distances and relative velocities provide reasonable time to react.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
