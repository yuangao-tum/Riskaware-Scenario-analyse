### Safety analysis for timestep 5.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30730.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 0.2 m, which is extremely close, posing an immediate risk of collision. There is no lateral distance to mitigate the threat.
- **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is -3.78 m/s. TTC can be calculated as:
    - \( \text{TTC} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Velocity}} = \frac{0.2 \text{ m}}{3.78 \text{ m/s}} \approx 0.053 \text{ s} \)
    This indicates an immediate risk of collision.
- **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30731.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 39.12 m while the lateral distance of -92.24 m indicates that the obstacle is far enough away laterally and not directly obstructing the path. No immediate threat.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: The longitudinal relative velocity is -2.69 m/s. TTC is:
    - \( \text{TTC} = \frac{39.12 \text{ m}}{2.69 \text{ m/s}} \approx 14.55 \text{ s} \)
    Hence, there is ample time to react and maneuver.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30733.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 0.17 m, indicating a very close distance posing a serious risk of collision. No lateral distance to provide safety.
- **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is -3.78 m/s. TTC is:
    - \( \text{TTC} = \frac{0.17 \text{ m}}{3.78 \text{ m/s}} \approx 0.045 \text{ s} \)
    This suggests an immediate risk of collision.
- **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

---

#### Obstacle ID: 30734.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 44.26 m, and the lateral distance of -20.0 m indicates that the obstacle is relatively far away and is not obstructing the path.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: The longitudinal relative velocity is -4.3 m/s. TTC is:
    - \( \text{TTC} = \frac{44.26 \text{ m}}{4.3 \text{ m/s}} \approx 10.28 \text{ s} \)
    This signifies that there is sufficient time to respond and alter the course if necessary.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "null",
        "OverallRiskScore": "null"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30730.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
```

### Conclusion:
- There are two obstacles (30730.0 and 30733.0) that have extreme risk scores of 1 due to very close proximities and very short times to collision. Immediate actions are required to prevent a collision. 
- The other two obstacles (30731.0 and 30734.0) present lower risk scores of 4 indicating manageable distances and ample time to react.
