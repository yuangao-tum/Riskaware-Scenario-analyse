### Safety analysis for timestep 5.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30730.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is very close with a longitudinal distance of 0.2 m and perfectly aligned laterally (0.0 m lateral distance). Immediate collision imminent if relative motion persists.
- **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Negative relative velocity (-3.78 m/s longitudinal) indicates the obstacle is approaching rapidly. Given the short distance, the TTC is extremely low or effectively 0.
- **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30731.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is at a safe longitudinal distance of 39.12 m but is laterally far at -92.24 m, indicating no immediate lateral threat.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Despite moving towards the ego vehicle, the high lateral distance and change in lateral position (13.46 m/s lateral velocity) allow ample reaction time.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30733.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Very close longitudinal distance (0.17 m) with lateral distance of -5.39 m; though slightly lateral, still near enough to be a risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Same longitudinal relative velocity as obstacle 30730.0 (-3.78 m/s), indicating rapid approach. Lateral motion is absent, reducing mitigation options related to lateral movement.
- **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30734.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is far (44.26 m), and lateral distance is moderate (-20.0 m). No immediate threat but requires monitoring.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The negative longitudinal velocity (-4.3 m/s) suggests the obstacle is closing the gap over time, though lateral motion (7.38 m/s laterally) suggests potential safe passage without collision.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30730.0",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  }
}
```

In the evaluation, Obstacle 30730.0 and Obstacle 30733.0 both present an immediate and extreme risk, primarily due to their proximity and negative relative velocities indicating an imminent collision if no corrective actions are taken.
