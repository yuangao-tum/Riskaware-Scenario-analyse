Safety analysis for timestep 5.7 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.7 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- Obstacle ID: 30730
  - Distance Risk Reason: Extremely close longitudinal distance (DTClong = 0.2), with exact lateral alignment (DTClat = 0.0). Front direction suggests immediate concern in the longitudinal direction.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0
  - Time Risk Reason: Immediate longitudinal collision risk, TTClong is very low (TTClong = 0.05), with exact lateral alignment (TTClat = 0.0).
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
  - Overall Risk Score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 30731
  - Distance Risk Reason: Safe longitudinal distance (DTClong = 39.12) and lateral distance (DTClat = 92.24) indicate negligible risk. 
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
  - Time Risk Reason: Safe longitudinal time (TTClong = 14.53) and moderate lateral time risk (TTClat = 6.85) but not concerning.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
  - Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30733
  - Distance Risk Reason: Extremely short longitudinal distance (DTClong = 0.17), while moderately safe lateral distance (DTClat = 5.39) and no lateral motion risk.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 2.5
  - Time Risk Reason: Immediate risk due to very low longitudinal time (TTClong = 0.04) and infinite lateral time, indicating no lateral collision risk.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 3.0
  - Overall Risk Score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30734
  - Distance Risk Reason: Very safe longitudinal distance (DTClong = 44.26) and moderately safe lateral distance (DTClat = 20.0).
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5
  - Time Risk Reason: Negligible risk with TTClong = 10.3 and low lateral risk with TTClat = 2.71.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 3
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 4.0
  - Overall Risk Score: 4
