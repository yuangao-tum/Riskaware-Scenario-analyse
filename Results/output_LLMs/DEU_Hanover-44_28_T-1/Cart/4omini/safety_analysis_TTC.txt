Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30730.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The ego vehicle is at positions (-430.4244, -380.2619) and the obstacle at (-432.9627, -384.2309). The minimum distance (MDC) is calculated as follows:
     \[
     MDC = \sqrt{((-430.4244 + 432.9627)^2 + (-380.2619 + 384.2309)^2)} \approx 4.121 \text{ units}
     \]
     This is quite close given the constant positions thus indicating a potential immediate risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk - close distance with potential collision)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary (velocity = 0). The TTC with the ego's relative motion can be computed relative to the approaching distance:
     \[
     TTC = \frac{MDC}{\text{Ego Velocity}} = \frac{4.121}{3.7841} \approx 1.09 \text{ seconds}
     \]
     Thus, the TTC indicates a collision will occur quickly.
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk - immediate collision risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30731.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The relative position of the obstacle and action taken can affect TTC based on the ego vehicle's trajectory. The distance calculation at this moment indicates:
     \[
     MDC = \sqrt{((-430.4244 + 532.9829)^2 + (-380.2619 + 366.3662)^2)} \approx 105.837 \text{ units}
     \]
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk - considerable distance)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving at a velocity of 13.5014 m/s which is perpendicular to the egoâ€™s motion, thus making TTC relevant primarily across the lateral direction.
     \[
     TTC \approx \frac{MDC}{\text{Obstacle Velocity}} \approx \frac{105.837}{13.5014} \approx 7.83 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk - significant time to react)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30733.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Similar to obstacle ID 30730.0, the ego vehicle is positioned at close distances:
     \[
     MDC = \sqrt{((-430.4244 + 438.8426)^2 + (-380.2619 + 380.4217)^2)} \approx 8.601 \text{ units}
     \]
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk - similar scenario to obstacle 30730.0)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary, so using the same logic:
     \[
     TTC \approx \frac{MDC}{3.7841} \approx 2.27 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk - immediate collision risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

---

4. **Obstacle ID: 30734.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance to the obstacle got calculated:
     \[
     MDC = \sqrt{((-430.4244 + 474.9241)^2 + (-380.2619 + 409.6678)^2)} \approx 52.246 \text{ units}
     \]
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk - significant distance)
   - **Time Risk reason**: As this vehicle has a relative motion (7.4022 m/s; would need to use velocity albeit slowing down):
     \[
     TTC \approx \frac{52.246}{7.4022} \approx 7.07 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk - sufficient time to react)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)
