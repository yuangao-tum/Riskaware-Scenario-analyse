Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30730.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (872.0) and very close to the ego vehicle with almost no separation in the lateral direction.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk: Very small distance to the ego vehicle)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The velocity of this obstacle is 0, which means any movement by the ego vehicle could lead to an immediate collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk: High likelihood of immediate collision due to stationary obstacle)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30731.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in a different lanelet (581.0) and far away from the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk: Far enough not to interfere)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Moving at a high velocity away from the ego vehicle with no probable intersecting path.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30733.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in a different lanelet (874.0) and stationary but close to the ego vehicle on a parallel trajectory.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk: Minimal risk due to lane difference)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Stationary with no intersecting path with the ego vehicle’s trajectory.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  
- **Obstacle ID: 30734.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in a different lanelet (901.0), with significant distance and a different orientation.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk: Sufficient separation in distance)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Moving away from the ego vehicle’s path, and the acceleration indicates it will be decreasing speed further.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)
