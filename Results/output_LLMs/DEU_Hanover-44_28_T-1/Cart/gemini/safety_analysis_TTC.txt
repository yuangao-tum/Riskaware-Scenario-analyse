Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30730**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet (872) as the ego vehicle and very close.  The small difference in y-coordinates (-380.26 vs -384.23) suggests a primarily longitudinal risk, although lateral movement should also be considered. The vehicles are nearly parallel (similar orientations).
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Since the obstacle is stationary and the ego vehicle is moving towards it, a collision is imminent unless the ego vehicle brakes or steers away.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30731**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (581). While the x-coordinate difference is significant (-430.42 vs -532.98), further analysis is needed to determine if the trajectories intersect. The significantly different orientation (-2.14 vs -0.65) suggests diverging paths, lessening the risk. 
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving with a substantial velocity (13.5 m/s). If its trajectory were to intersect with the ego vehicle's, the high speed would make collision avoidance challenging. However, with diverging paths, the TTC is likely high.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30733**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (874) and slightly behind the ego vehicle in the x-direction.  The small lateral offset suggests it's close in the y-direction.  This represents a potential lateral collision risk, particularly if the ego vehicle attempts a lane change.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: As the obstacle is stationary, the primary risk depends on the ego vehicle's movements. If the ego vehicle maintains its lane and decelerates, the TTC should be high.  However, a lane change towards this obstacle would significantly reduce TTC.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 30734**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (901) and significantly further behind the ego vehicle (-430.42 vs -474.92 in x-direction). While the y-coordinate difference (-380.26 vs -409.67) indicates some lateral separation, the different orientations (-2.14 vs -0.50) imply they might be moving in different directions.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: This obstacle's velocity (7.4 m/s) and deceleration (-5.9 m/sÂ²) suggest it is slowing down. The TTC will depend on whether its trajectory intersects with the ego vehicle's and the relative speeds.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)
