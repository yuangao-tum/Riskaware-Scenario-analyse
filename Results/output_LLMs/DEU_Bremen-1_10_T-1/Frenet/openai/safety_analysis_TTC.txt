### Safety analysis for timestep 14.3: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30294.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is 23.42 m laterally to the right (DTClat = -23.42 m) but has longitudinal position 0.0 m (DTClong = 0.0 m). This could potentially create a collision risk if they continue on their current paths.
  - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocity shows the obstacle is approaching with a lateral velocity of 0.82 m/s and has no longitudinal movement. With a lateral distance of -23.42 m, there is an imminent collision path defined by TTC = 0.0 s.
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 30295.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is laterally close (1.67 m to the left), creating a potential collision path if it continues toward the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacles' relative velocity is -1.6 m/s longitudinally and -1.53 m/s laterally, leading to imminent collision: TTC calculated based on a 1.67 m distance gives approximately 1.09 s which suggests a probable collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 30296.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is at a distance of 5.97 m in front-right, which may lead to interaction if there is no relative motion.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle shows no relative motion (TTC would also be 5.97 m, divided by 0 m/s = not applicable), thus maintaining a safe distance.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 30297.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is positioned 4.72m behind and laterally 16.8m, not representing a direct collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle has no movement, making the time to collision not applicable. Safe distance maintained.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 30298.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned at 8.19m longitudinal and 18.26m laterally, posing no immediate risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Has no relative movement, resulting in negligible impact on collision path. 
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 30299.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** 3.59m longitudinally and -10.90m laterally away from the ego vehicle presents no imminent danger.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** No relative movement signals. Hence, the risk is insignificant.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 30300.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The large distance (93.75m longitudinal and 62.37m laterally) indicates no risk from this obstacle.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** As the obstacle is moving away, there is no collision risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 30304.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** There is dangerous proximity with this obstacle due to its backward approach.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** It would depend on velocity for a more accurate score but since it is moving laterally away, there is some level of control.
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 30305.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Close proximity of 4.42 m longitudinally and 2.05 m laterally could lead to a potential collision.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocities suggest an approach speed which may pose a collision risk, indicating significant urgency.
  - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 30306.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance of 13.28m with lateral distance of 13.64m indicates a moderate risk of collision.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is approaching with a moderate closing speed, calculations suggest it approaches faster than our ego vehicle. 
  - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 30308.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Identified as colliding at the exact position (0.0m, 0.0m).
  - **Distance safety score:** 0 (Collision Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Instant collision as they occupy the same location.
  - **Time safety score:** 0 (Collision Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 0 (Collision Risk)

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 30309.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The distance of 10.38m longitudinal and 6.98m lateral creates a mild risk of collision.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Moving relatively toward the ego vehicle but outside immediate danger.
  - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 30310.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The 5.92m longitudinal and 7.92m lateral proximity may escalate to risk quickly.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Significant relative velocity causes concerns on collision imminent status.
  - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)
