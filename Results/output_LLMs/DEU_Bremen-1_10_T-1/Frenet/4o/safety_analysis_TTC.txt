### Safety analysis for timestep 14.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30294.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The lateral distance is significant (-23.42m) and the obstacle is toward the right side of the vehicle, implying minimal immediate risk.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The obstacle is aligned laterally with a relative velocity moving away from the ego vehicle (0.82 m/s lateral), resulting in a negligible collision path.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30295.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Very close lateral distance (1.67m) on the left, presenting a potential risk.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Obstacle moves laterally and longitudinally toward the ego vehicle, resulting in a short TTC.
  - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30296.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Both lateral and longitudinal positions indicate no current threat of collision (longitudinal 5.97m, lateral -37.88m).
  - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: No relative motion towards the ego vehicle in either direction.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30297.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is close (rear-right at 4.72m) but there is no significant relative movement.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Lack of relative motion implies no immediate collision risk.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30298.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Located at the rear-right with a decent buffer distance (8.19m).
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: No motion towards the ego vehicle.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30299.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Very close at rear-right (3.59m), increases the risk slightly.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Minimal motion, allowing some reaction time.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30300.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Far in rear-left direction with significant distance (93.75m).
  - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Moving away, implying no collision threat.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30301.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Slightly behind in rear-right (0.31m), close proximity but static position.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: No relative motion indicates manageable risk.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30304.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Positioned at the rear-right but a manageable distance (11.39m).
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Lateral movement indicates it's moving away.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30305.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Very close in front-left (longitudinal 4.42m, lateral 2.05m), posing clear collision risk.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Despite low speeds, direct approach indicates potential for collision.
  - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30306.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Positioned front-left (longitudinal 13.28m, lateral 13.64m) with reasonable distance.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: moderate speeds implies controllable risk.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30307.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Positioned in the right with a lateral separation of 36.73m.
  - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: No motion toward the ego vehicle yields low risk.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30308.0**

  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Moderate speed, manageable risk.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30310.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Closely front-left (longitudinal 5.92m, lateral 7.92m), increased risk.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: High relative speed toward the ego increases risk.
  - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 3
