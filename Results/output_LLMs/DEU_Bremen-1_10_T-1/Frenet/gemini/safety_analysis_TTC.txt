### Safety analysis for timestep 14.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**Calculations Note:**  For stationary objects or those with zero relative velocity, TTC is considered infinite (represented as "inf"). MDC is simply the current distance. For other scenarios, we approximate TTC using distance/velocity. This simplification assumes constant velocity, which might not be entirely accurate in real-world scenarios where accelerations are involved. A more comprehensive analysis would consider the kinematic equations of motion.

- **Obstacle ID: 30294.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Lateral distance is significant, but the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Lateral TTC depends on the lateral speed and exact trajectory, but poses some risk given the movement. Longitudinal motion is not a concern.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30295.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Very close laterally and longitudinally aligned. High risk of collision.
