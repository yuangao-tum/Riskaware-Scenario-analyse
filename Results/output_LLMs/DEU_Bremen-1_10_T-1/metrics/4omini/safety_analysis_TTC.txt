Safety analysis for timestep 14.3 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 14.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30294
- **Relative Direction:** Right
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Longitudinal distance indicates collision (0.0) which signifies an immediate risk, while a lateral distance of 23.42 shows considerable separation. Since DTClong = 0, it is classified as collision risk.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 0  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 4
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 0 (Weighted score: 0 * 1 + 4 * 0 = 0)
- **Time Risk Reason:** Longitudinal TTC is also 0 (indicating immediate collision), and lateral TTC of 28.44 gives sufficient time to avert a collision but does not compensate for the zero longitudinal value. Hence, itâ€™s classified as collision risk.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 0
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 4
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 0 (Weighted score: 0 * 1 + 4 * 0 = 0)
- **Overall Risk Score:** 0

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30295
- **Relative Direction:** Left
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Similar to Obstacle 30294, the longitudinal distance indicates a collision (0.0) while the lateral distance is 1.67, showing minimal separation.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 0  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 2
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 0 (Weighted score: 0 * 1 + 2 * 0 = 0)
- **Time Risk Reason:** Both longitudinal and lateral TTC are 0 and pose a significant immediate risk of collision.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 0
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 2
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 0 (Weighted score: 0 * 1 + 2 * 0 = 0)
- **Overall Risk Score:** 0

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30308
- **Relative Direction:** Collision
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Both DTC values are 0, indicating an imminent collision.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 0  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 0
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 0 (Weighted score: 0 * 1 + 0 * 0 = 0)
- **Time Risk Reason:** Both TTC values are 0, indicating an imminent collision.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 0
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 0
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 0 (Weighted score: 0 * 1 + 0 * 0 = 0)
- **Overall Risk Score:** 0

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30310
- **Relative Direction:** Front-left
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Longitudinal distance is 5.92, indicating moderate space from a collision, while lateral distance of 7.92 should allow for an adequate buffer.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 3  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 3
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 3 (Weighted score: 3 * 0.5 + 3 * 0.5 = 3)
- **Time Risk Reason:** Longitudinal TTC is 3.88 and lateral TTC is 6.47, indicating enough time to react.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 4
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 4
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 4 (Weighted score: 4 * 0.5 + 4 * 0.5 = 4)
- **Overall Risk Score:** 3 (0.5 * 3 + 0.5 * 4 = 3.5 rounded down to 3)

### Summary in JSON Format: 
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30294",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
``` 

### Conclusion:
Observations reveal a critical risk scenario with several obstacles presenting immediate collision threats, particularly from Obstacles 30294, 30295, and 30308. The only risk-free obstacle lies in the moderate range with obstacle 30310, which has a risk score of 3.
