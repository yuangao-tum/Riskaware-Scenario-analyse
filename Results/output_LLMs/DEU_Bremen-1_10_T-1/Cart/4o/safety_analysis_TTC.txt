Safety analysis for the last timestep (14.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 14.3: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30294**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Given the position of this obstacle relative to the ego vehicle and its movement, it is in a separate lanelet and is moving slowly away from the ego vehicle.
    - **Distance safety score**: 4
    - **Time Risk reason**: With a low velocity and negative acceleration, there's no imminent collision risk in terms of time.
    - **Time safety score**: 4
    - **Overall Risk score**: 4

2. **Obstacle ID: 30295**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is in the same lanelet and very close to the ego vehicle, which is stationary.
    - **Distance safety score**: 2
    - **Time Risk reason**: The relatively quicker speed of this obstacle and its location in the same lanelet suggests a possible collision path.
    - **Time safety score**: 2
    - **Overall Risk score**: 2

3. **Obstacle ID: 30296**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in a distant lanelet, stationary, and far from the ego path.
    - **Distance safety score**: 5
    - **Time Risk reason**: No velocity means no collision path over time.
    - **Time safety score**: 5
    - **Overall Risk score**: 5

4. **Obstacle ID: 30297**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in a different lanelet and also stationary.
    - **Distance safety score**: 5
    - **Time Risk reason**: Zero velocity leads to no temporal collision risk.

    - **Overall Risk score**: 5

5. **Obstacle ID: 30298**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary and located in a different lanelet.
    - **Distance safety score**: 5
    - **Time Risk reason**: Similar to others with zero velocity, presents no immediate collision risk.
    - **Time safety score**: 5
    - **Overall Risk score**: 5

6. **Obstacle ID: 30299**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: It is stationary and positioned farther away in a different lanelet.
    - **Distance safety score**: 5
    - **Time Risk reason**: No movement means no risk over time.
    - **Time safety score**: 5
    - **Overall Risk score**: 5

7. **Obstacle ID: 30300**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Although moving quickly, it is far away and heading in a different trajectory.
    - **Distance safety score**: 5
    - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity but on a non-colliding path due to orientation and trajectory.
    - **Time safety score**: 5
    - **Overall Risk score**: 5

8. **Obstacle ID: 30301**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary and located in a separated path.
    - **Distance safety score**: 5
    - **Time Risk reason**: Zero velocity and non-colliding course.
    - **Time safety score**: 5
    - **Overall Risk score**: 5

9. **Obstacle ID: 30304**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Minimal movement and outside immediate trajectory.
    - **Distance safety score**: 5
    - **Time Risk reason**: The very slow change in speed indicates no urgent time risk.
    - **Time safety score**: 5
    - **Overall Risk score**: 5

10. **Obstacle ID: 30305**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Close to the ego vehicle but with minimal speed and negative acceleration.
    - **Distance safety score**: 4
    - **Time Risk reason**: Slow movement and the ego vehicle being stationary points to manageable risk.
    - **Time safety score**: 4
    - **Overall Risk score**: 4

11. **Obstacle ID: 30306**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Situated in another lanelet, moving but far and not on a collision path.
    - **Distance safety score**: 5
    - **Time Risk reason**: Moderate speed but with a positive trajectory away from the ego vehicle.
    - **Time safety score**: 5
    - **Overall Risk score**: 5

12. **Obstacle ID: 30307**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary and located at a safe lanelet distance.
    - **Distance safety score**: 5
    - **Time Risk reason**: No velocity ensures no immediate collision risk.
    - **Time safety score**: 5
    - **Overall Risk score**: 5

13. **Obstacle ID: 30308**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Located close to the ego vehicle in a nearby lane but stationary.
    - **Distance safety score**: 4
    - **Time Risk reason**: No movement and in a stable position implies negligible time risk.
    - **Time safety score**: 5
    - **Overall Risk score**: 5

14. **Obstacle ID: 30309**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Moderate distance and speed with negative acceleration.
    - **Distance safety score**: 4
    - **Time Risk reason**: The slow speed and deceleration allow for adequate monitoring without immediate concern.
    - **Time safety score**: 4
    - **Overall Risk score**: 4

15. **Obstacle ID: 30310**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in a non-threatening trajectory with significant separation.
    - **Distance safety score**: 5
    - **Time Risk reason**: Moving away ensures minimal risk over time.
    - **Time safety score**: 5
    - **Overall Risk score**: 5
