Safety analysis for the last timestep (14.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 14.3: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**Obstacle ID: 30294.0**
- Distance Risk reason: The minimum distance to the obstacle is approximately 4.5 meters (calculated), and since this obstacle is moving in the same lanelet and moving toward the Ego vehicle, the risk is significant.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The TTC is calculated to be around 6.7 seconds, indicating an imminent but non-immediate risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

---

**Obstacle ID: 30295.0**
- Distance Risk reason: The distance between Ego and this obstacle is changing, with a minimum distance calculated at approximately 5.2 meters.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The TTC is approximately 5.1 seconds, which is significant enough for the Ego to react appropriately.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

---

**Obstacle ID: 30306.0**
- Distance Risk reason: The distance to this obstacle is minimal and significant changes exist due to its momentum. The minimum distance is approximately 16 meters.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The TTC is around 8 seconds, giving enough time for the Ego vehicle to react.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

---

**Obstacle ID: 30308.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is stationary and the minimum distance from the Ego vehicle is approximately 4.5 meters.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The TTC is effectively infinite (obstacle is stationary), but due to proximity, it poses a significant threat.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

---

**Obstacle ID: 30309.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is moving slowly and the minimum distance calculated is approximately 8 meters, posing a minor risk.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The TTC is about 7 seconds, providing sufficient time for adjustments.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

---

**Obstacle ID: 30310.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is moving on a parallel path and the calculated minimum distance is around 10 meters, indicating safety.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The TTC is around 7.1 seconds, which offers sufficient time for navigation.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:

    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
``` 

### Conclusion:
The analysis shows that while there are significant challenges, particularly with obstacles 30294.0 and 30295.0, there are no immediate collisions (0 risk), nor extreme risks of collision (1 risk). The highest risk involves obstacles on close trajectories, demanding attention and careful navigation from the Ego vehicle. Overall, risks remain manageable with proper strategies and interventions.
