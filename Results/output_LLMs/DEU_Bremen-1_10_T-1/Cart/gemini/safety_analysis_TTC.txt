Safety analysis for the last timestep (14.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 14.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

The ego vehicle is stationary (velocity and acceleration are 0).  This simplifies the analysis, as we primarily need to consider the obstacles' motion relative to the ego's static position.

**Assumptions:** Since no dimensions of the vehicles are given, we will assume point-like objects for this analysis.  A more realistic analysis would require vehicle dimensions and shapes. Also, we are lacking information on lanelet geometry, which makes definitive statements about lateral risk difficult without further information.  We can only infer relative risk based on position and velocity vectors.

**Methodology:**  Due to the lack of lanelet information and vehicle dimensions, a precise TTC or MDC calculation is impossible. We'll use a qualitative approach based on the provided data to estimate risk.
