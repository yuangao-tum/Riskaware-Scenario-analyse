### Safety analysis for timestep 7.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30667.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The real longitudinal distance is 46.97 m and lateral distance is 5.9 m. The obstacle is moving away which indicates a decreasing risk.
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal relative velocity is 7.28 m/s, which indicates good distance, and as it moves away, the time to collision is calculable as long (TTC_long = 46.97 / 7.28 = 6.44 s). No lateral collision risk since it is moving away.
   - Time safety score: 4
   - Overall Risk score: 4

2. **Obstacle ID: 30671.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Real distances are -4.12 m longitudinally, indicating it's already in a collision position, but moving away laterally.
   - Distance safety score: 3
   - Time Risk reason: With a negative longitudinal distance and a slight -0.29 m/s longitudinal velocity, the immediate risk of collision is viable but can be traversed if maneuvering is swift. TTC_long can be approximated as negative, reflecting that collision is imminent without immediate corrective actions. 
   - Time safety score: 2
   - Overall Risk score: 2 

3. **Obstacle ID: 30673.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance is 0.0 m and lateral distance is -32.46 m indicating no lateral safety net. However, the obstacle is moving away laterally.
   - Distance safety score: 3
   - Time Risk reason: With relative longitudinal velocity of 3.5 m/s, and positioned as a concern with exact alignment. Time to collision will be calculated as being less favorable but manageable (TTC_long = 0.0 m / 3.5 = 0.0). This indicates a critical immediate clash.
   - Time safety score: 2
   - Overall Risk score: 2

4. **Obstacle ID: 30674.0** 
   - Distance Risk reason: Exact longitudinal and lateral alignment with 0.0 m reflects an immediate collision scenario.
   - Distance safety score: 1
   - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity of 7.57 m/s indicates a risk of collision that is very high with no escape at this exact moment (TTC_long = 0.0 / 7.57 = 0.0 s).
   - Time safety score: 1
   - Overall Risk score: 1

5. **Obstacle ID: 30675.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Real distance longitudinally -15.52 m indicates it's approaching rapidly from behind, but of no immediate risk.
   - Distance safety score: 3
   - Time Risk reason: The negative distance's high relative longitudinal velocity of 4.51 m/s means the potential collision is highly likely in the near future (TTC_long = -15.52 / 4.51 is not calculable).
   - Time safety score: 2 
   - Overall Risk score: 2

6. **Obstacle ID: 30676.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Exact alignment longitudinally with a lateral distance of 1.88 m indicates that the obstacle is approaching but not immediate collision risk.
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: Its relative longitudinal velocity of -0.3 m/s signifies it is moving away, however, the immediate danger might increase but it doesn't signify a current threat (TTC_long is manageable: 0.0 / 0.3 = 0.0 (infinitely approach)).
   - Time safety score: 3 
   - Overall Risk score: 3

7. **Obstacle ID: 30677.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance is 9.55 m while laterally it's 2.22 m. The obstacle is closing in longitudinally.
   - Distance safety score: 3
   - Time Risk reason: The longitudinal relative velocity of -0.46 m/s means it is approaching. TTC can be calculated (TTC_long = 9.55 / -0.46 = -20.8 s), indicating a controllable situation.
   - Time safety score: 3
   - Overall Risk score: 3

8. **Obstacle ID: 30678.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance of 1.89 m and lateral distance of 1.93 m indicates it is very close.
   - Distance safety score: 2
   - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity of -0.32 m/s means it's moving towards the ego vehicle. TTC_long = 1.89 / -0.32 = -5.91 s indicates an immediate risk of collision.
   - Time safety score: 2
   - Overall Risk score: 2 

9. **Obstacle ID: 30679.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance 26.62 m and lateral distance 4.21 m indicates a moderate risk but manageable with timely reactions.
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal velocity of -1.69 m/s indicates it's approaching. TTC_long = 26.62 / -1.69 = 15.74 s indicates that it has time but requires watching.
   - Time safety score: 3
   - Overall Risk score: 3 

10. **Obstacle ID: 30680.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance of 17.66 m and lateral distance of 2.95 m indicates minimal risk.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Though it is a modest longitudinal velocity at -0.92 m/s, it's a longer TTC (TTC_long = 17.66 / -0.92 = 19.19 s).
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

11. **Obstacle ID: 30681.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance is 36.63 m and lateral is 6.29 m, retracting from the ego vehicle.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity is -2.62 m/s, with sufficient time reflecting a stable situation (TTC_long = 36.63 / -2.62 = 13.94 s).
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5
