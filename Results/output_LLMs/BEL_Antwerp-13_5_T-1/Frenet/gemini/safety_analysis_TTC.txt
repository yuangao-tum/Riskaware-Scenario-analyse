### Safety analysis for timestep 7.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30667.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located 46.97m longitudinally and 5.9m laterally in the front-left, moving away in both directions.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away, no TTC calculation needed.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30671.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 4.12m behind and 1.88m to the left, moving away longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, no TTC calculation needed.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30673.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 32.46m laterally to the right, moving away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away, no TTC calculation needed.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30674.0**
- Distance Risk reason: At 0 distance longitudinally and laterally, indicating a collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason:  Collision imminent.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 30675.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 15.52m behind, approaching longitudinally. Lateral distance is 0, but exact lateral alignment is assumed. Further analysis is needed with more timestamps to determine if a collision risk exists.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally but given lateral position of the obstacle, longitudinal movement is considered safe. It’s assumed the ego vehicle won’t be moving backward.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30676.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 1.88m laterally to the left, approaching laterally. Longitudinal distance is 0.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching laterally. Requires immediate attention.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 30677.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 9.55m longitudinally and 2.22m laterally in the front-left, approaching in both directions.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching, requires attention.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 30678.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located 1.89m longitudinally and 1.93m laterally in the front-left, approaching in both directions.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Very close, high risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 30679.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 26.62m longitudinally and 4.21m laterally in the front-left, approaching in both directions.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching, monitoring required.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30680.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 17.66m longitudinally and 2.95m laterally in the front-left, approaching in both directions.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching, monitoring required.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30681.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 36.63m longitudinally and 6.29m laterally in front-left, approaching in both directions.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching, but ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
