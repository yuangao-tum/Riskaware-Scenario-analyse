### Safety analysis for timestep 7.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30667.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is 46.97 m (safe distance) and lateral distance is 5.9 m (also safe). The obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5
   - **Time Risk reason:** Relative velocities (longitudinal 7.28 m/s and lateral 2.81 m/s) indicate it is moving away, so the time to collision (TTC) is negative or high, meaning no collision risk.
   - **Time safety score:** 5
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 30671.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is -4.12 m (very close) and lateral distance is 1.88 m. The obstacle is moving away.
   - **Distance safety score:** 3
   - **Time Risk reason:** With a longitudinal relative velocity of -0.29 m/s, it indicates a high chance of the ego vehicle approaching fast. Thus, the TTC is decreasing.
   - **Time safety score:** 2
   - **Overall Risk score:** 2

3. **Obstacle ID: 30673.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is 0.0 m (exact alignment) and lateral distance is -32.46 m, indicating potential proximity.
   - **Distance safety score:** 1
   - **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocity indicates the ego vehicle is very close to this obstacle with potential collision.
   - **Time safety score:** 1
   - **Overall Risk score:** 1

4. **Obstacle ID: 30674.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is 0.0 m and lateral distance is 0.0 m, meaning the vehicle is in a collision scenario.
   - **Distance safety score:** 0
   - **Time Risk reason:** High relative velocity longitudinally presents immediate collision.
   - **Time safety score:** 1
   - **Overall Risk score:** 0

5. **Obstacle ID: 30675.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is -15.52 m (very close proximity) and lateral distance is 0.0 m. The obstacle is moving toward the ego car.
   - **Distance safety score:** 1
   - **Time Risk reason:** Relative velocity of 4.51 m/s suggests a quick approach.
   - **Time safety score:** 2
   - **Overall Risk score:** 1

6. **Obstacle ID: 30676.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is 0.0 m and lateral distance is 1.88 m, indicating collision potential.
   - **Distance safety score:** 1
   - **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocity indicates it is moving toward the ego vehicle.
   - **Time safety score:** 1
   - **Overall Risk score:** 0

7. **Obstacle ID: 30677.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is 9.55 m and lateral distance is 2.22 m. The obstacle is closing in.
   - **Distance safety score:** 3
   - **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocity suggests it is moving toward the ego vehicle.
   - **Time safety score:** 2
   - **Overall Risk score:** 2

8. **Obstacle ID: 30678.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is 1.89 m and lateral distance is 1.93 m (very close).
   - **Distance safety score:** 2
   - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is moving toward the ego vehicle suggesting imminent collision.
   - **Time safety score:** 1
   - **Overall Risk score:** 1

9. **Obstacle ID: 30679.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is 26.62 m and lateral distance is 4.21 m, indicating it is far enough.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4
   - **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocity shows it's closing toward the ego vehicle, but still sufficiently far.
   - **Time safety score:** 4
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4

10. **Obstacle ID: 30680.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is 17.66 m and lateral distance is 2.95 m (relatively safe).
    - **Distance safety score:** 4
    - **Time Risk reason:** Indicating it is moving towards the vehicle yet manageable.
    - **Time safety score:** 3
    - **Overall Risk score:** 4

11. **Obstacle ID: 30681.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is 36.63 m and lateral distance is 6.29 m (far enough).
    - **Distance safety score:** 5
    - **Time Risk reason:** The distance is sufficient to consider possible reaction time.
    - **Time safety score:** 5
    - **Overall Risk score:** 5
