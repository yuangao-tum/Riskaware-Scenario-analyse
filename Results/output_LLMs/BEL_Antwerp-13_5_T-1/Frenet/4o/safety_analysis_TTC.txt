### Safety analysis for timestep 7.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30667.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is at a safe longitudinal distance (46.97 m) and is moving away both longitudinally and laterally.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: The relative velocity and acceleration suggest that the obstacle is moving away in both dimensions, increasing TTC.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30671.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The longitudinal distance is negative (-4.12 m) indicating it has passed the ego vehicle and is moving away, posing no threat.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Relatively low speeds and negative acceleration imply the obstacle is decelerating and doesn’t threaten collision. 
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30673.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is laterally very distant (-32.46 m) with no immediate collision risk.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: The lateral movement away increases the TTC significantly.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30674.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is at the same longitudinal and lateral position (0.0 m), indicating an immediate collision.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 0
- **Time Risk Reason**: As TTC equals zero, indicating immediate collision without intervention.
- **Time Safety Score**: 0
- **Overall Risk Score**: 0

#### Obstacle ID: 30675.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is 15.52 m behind, moving toward the ego car which must be monitored, but currently poses manageable risk.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3
- **Time Risk Reason**: While it is approaching, there’s time to respond before it reaches the ego vehicle.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30676.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The lateral distance (1.88 m) suggests it's close, but relative movement is minimal.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3
- **Time Risk Reason**: Relative movement is minimal and manageable with time.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30677.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle is moderately close (9.55 m, 2.22 m) and moving towards the ego vehicle.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 2
- **Time Risk Reason**: Negative relative velocity requires prompt reaction.
- **Time Safety Score**: 2
- **Overall Risk Score**: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 30678.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Very close to the ego vehicle (1.89 m, 1.93 m) with movement toward the vehicle.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 1
- **Time Risk Reason**: Short TTC requiring urgent reaction to avoid collision.
- **Time Safety Score**: 1
- **Overall Risk Score**: 1

#### Obstacle ID: 30679.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is farther away (26.62 m, 4.21 m) but moving toward the ego vehicle.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 2
- **Time Risk Reason**: Although moving toward the ego vehicle, enough time exists to react.
- **Time Safety Score**: 2
- **Overall Risk Score**: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 30680.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Moderate proximity (17.66 m, 2.95 m) but caution is required as it moves toward the ego vehicle.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 2
- **Time Risk Reason**: Approach rate suggests needing quick action but manageable.
- **Time Safety Score**: 2
- **Overall Risk Score**: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 30681.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Longitudinal distance (36.63 m) and lateral distance (6.29 m) are relatively safe for now.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3
- **Time Risk Reason**: Though moving towards the ego car, provides time for response.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3
