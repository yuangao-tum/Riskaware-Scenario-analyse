Safety analysis for the last timestep (7.3 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario and evaluate collision risks:

Key observations:
1. Ego vehicle starts in lanelet 576, moves to lanelet 1332, then to lanelet 120
2. Several obstacles share or cross these lanelets

Detailed Analysis:

1. Obstacle 30674:
- Initially shares lanelet 576 with ego
- Moves alongside ego vehicle through lanelets 1332 and 120
- MDC: ~8-10 meters at closest approach
- TTC: >4 seconds with safe lateral separation
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low risk)
- Time safety score: 4 (Low risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4

2. Obstacle 30675:
- Shares initial lanelet 576
- Similar trajectory to ego
- MDC: ~10-12 meters maintained
- TTC: >5 seconds
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low risk)
- Time safety score: 4 (Low risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4

3. Obstacle 30673:
- Crosses ego's path from lanelet 1332 to 131
- MDC: ~15 meters at crossing point
- TTC: >3 seconds during crossing
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium risk)
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3

4. Obstacle 30667:
- In lanelet 120 when ego enters
- Maintains safe distance ahead
- MDC: >20 meters
- TTC: >6 seconds
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible risk)
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5

No obstacles present immediate collision risk (score 0) or extreme risk (score 1). Here's the JSON summary:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Key safety findings:
1. All obstacles maintain safe distances
2. No critical TTC values observed
3. Lane changes are executed with sufficient gaps
4. Speed differentials are manageable
5. No immediate collision risks identified
