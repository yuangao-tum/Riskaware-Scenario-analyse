Safety analysis for the last timestep (7.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 7.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories, dimensions of vehicles, and definitions of "longitudinal" and "lateral" relative to each vehicle's heading are not provided, I'm making some simplified assumptions for this analysis.

* **Point Objects:** Vehicles are treated as point objects.
* **Constant Velocity and Acceleration:** I'll use the provided instantaneous velocity and acceleration but assume they remain constant for a short prediction horizon to estimate TTC.  This is a simplification, and real-world scenarios would require more sophisticated trajectory prediction.
* **Euclidean Distance for MDC:** I'll use the Euclidean distance between ego and obstacles for MDC.
* **TTC Approximation:** TTC is approximated based on the current relative velocity and distance. This is an approximation.
* **Longitudinal and Lateral Definitions:** I assume longitudinal refers to the direction of the ego vehicle's heading, and lateral is perpendicular to it.  Precise calculations would require more information on each vehicle's heading and intended path.


**Calculations and Reasoning:**


This analysis uses a simplified approach to risk assessment given the lack of detailed trajectory information. A comprehensive analysis would require vehicle dimensions, precise trajectory predictions, and potentially map data.  

A further explanation of assigning the risk scores is:

* **Distance Safety Score**: Calculated using MDC primarily.  Shorter distances get lower scores. I am using rough thresholds based on typical vehicle sizes and safe following distances.  Precise distances would need to be calibrated based on the specific autonomous driving system's requirements.

  * 0-2 meters: Score 1 (Extreme Risk)
  * 2-5 meters: Score 2 (High Risk)
  * 5-10 meters: Score 3 (Medium Risk)
  * 10-20 meters: Score 4 (Low Risk)
  * > 20 meters: Score 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Time Safety Score**: Calculated primarily using TTC. Shorter times get lower scores.

  * TTC < 1 second: Score 1 (Extreme Risk)
  * 1-3 seconds: Score 2 (High Risk)
  * 3-5 seconds: Score 3 (Medium Risk)
  * 5-10 seconds: Score 4 (Low Risk)
  * > 10 seconds: Score 5 (Negligible Risk)


* **Overall Risk Score**: The lower of the Distance and Time Safety scores. This reflects the idea that a situation is only as safe as its weakest link.
