    - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30675.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance of approximately 11.6401 meters indicates a relatively close potential encounter.
    - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
    - **Time Risk reason**: With a relatively high velocity (8.5487 m/s) heading towards the ego vehicle, the time to collision is about 1.36 seconds.
    - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30673.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance measure of approximately 30.1806 meters is notable but presents potential risk.
    - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - **Time Risk reason**: With a velocity of 6.871 m/s, the time to collision is calculated at approximately 4.39 seconds.
    - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30676.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance of approximately 1.1284 meters indicates a high likelihood of conflict.
    - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
    - **Time Risk reason**: With very minimal velocity (0.0023 m/s), collision is imminent at time zero.
    - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30671.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: The ego vehicle is approximately 2.9493 meters from this obstacle, which poses a risk.
    - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
    - **Time Risk reason**: Since the obstacle is stationary, it will stay at the same position, thus yielding a time to collision of indefinite time; however, relative motion increase collision potential.
    - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30680.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Approximately 4.6375 meters away with low velocity of 0.6272 indicates some risk.
    - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - **Time Risk reason**: With the low velocity, the time to collision would be around 7.40 seconds, reducing immediate concern.
    - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30677.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: At approximately 12.0342 meters distance, there is reassurance but it's still close enough to raise concerns.
    - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - **Time Risk reason**: With a low velocity of 0.1668, the time to collision is sufficiently long, suggesting lower risk.
    - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30679.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance of approximately 13.8896 meters reduces the likelihood of an impeding collision.
    - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
    - **Time Risk reason**: With a moderate velocity of 1.4194, the time to collision is approximately 9.79 seconds, indicating manageable risk.
    - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30678.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is approximately 8.6407 meters away, thus indicating manageable risk.
    - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
    - **Time Risk reason**: With very low velocity of 0.0274, the time to any potential collision would be unhurried.
    - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30681.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance of approximately 15.9150 meters indicates it is far enough to be considered controllable.
    - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
    - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle has a velocity of 2.4011, leading to a time to collision calculated at approximately 6.64 seconds, suggesting no imminent danger.
    - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)
