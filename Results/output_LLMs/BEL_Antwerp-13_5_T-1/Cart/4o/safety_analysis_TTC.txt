Safety analysis for the last timestep (7.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 7.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30667
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is located in the same lanelet (120.0) as the ego vehicle. The obstacle at position (-337.6421, -266.8869) is approximately 55.3 meters away from the ego vehicle position (-306.9728, -224.8681), calculated considering the Euclidean distance. The distance suggests a moderate level of risk given the same lanelet and high velocity.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: With obstacle velocity of 8.0739 m/s and ego velocity of 0.2929 m/s, the longitudinal relative speed will reduce the separation quickly. The ego vehicle's deceleration may help but significant lateral proximity increases risk. The estimated TTC is low, inferring an elevated risk.
- **Time safety score**: 2
- **Overall Risk score**: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 30671
- **Distance Risk reason**: Different lanelet (119.0), stationary obstacle. Minimal lateral risk given separation and lack of velocity.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: With zero velocity, there is a negligible risk of collision over time unless the ego changes lanes improperly.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30673
- **Distance Risk reason**: Separation of approximately 33.7 meters considering differing lanelet (131.0) adds to lateral safety. The trajectory suggests a moderate lateral risk given the overall area proximity.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Moving away from ego vehicle at a velocity of 6.871 m/s indicating an overall negligible direct time collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30674
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle, located in the same lanelet, is in immediate proximity (around 3.3 meters) to the ego vehicle. High closeness implies an extreme risk of potential immediate contact.
- **Distance safety score**: 1
- **Time Risk reason**: Velocity of 7.861 m/s with positive acceleration increases risk substantially. TTC is critically low due to minimal separation.
- **Time safety score**: 1
- **Overall Risk score**: 1

#### Obstacle ID: 30675
- **Distance Risk reason**: Different lanelet (1331.0) with adequate distance provides moderate separation comfort.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: High speed but decelerating, moving generally out of collision path diminishing the time risk further.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30676
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary and located in a different lanelet with a 1.24 meter separation, insignificant collision risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Lacks velocity, eliminating time-based collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30677
- **Distance Risk reason**: Different lanelet with adequate separation, minimal immediate risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Low speed and relatively stationary indicating critical time-related collision chances are negligible.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30678
- **Distance Risk reason**: Slight proximity in a different lanelet but stationary suggests minor risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Insignificant velocity eliminates significant time risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30679
- **Distance Risk reason**: Sufficient lateral distance presence in different lanelet results in low distance risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity moving relative to ego vehicle suggests negligible time collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30680
- **Distance Risk reason**: In different lanelet ensuring safety, meaningful spatial separation.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Slow velocity suggests negligible risk on TTC.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30681
- **Distance Risk reason**: Off-lanelet positioning with safety in distance.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Moderate speed, deflecting significantly from path reducing time collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 4
