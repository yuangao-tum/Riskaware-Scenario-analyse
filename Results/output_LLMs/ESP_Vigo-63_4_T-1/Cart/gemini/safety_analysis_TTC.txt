Safety analysis for the last timestep (8.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 8.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* **TTC Calculation:**  A precise TTC calculation requires detailed trajectory predictions for both ego and obstacle vehicles. Since trajectory information isn't provided,  I'll make approximations based on current velocities and positions.  I'll denote longitudinal TTC as TTClong and lateral TTC as TTClat.
* **MDC Calculation:** Similarly, MDC requires trajectory predictions. I'll estimate minimum distance based on current positions and headings, referring to longitudinal minimum distance as MDClong and lateral minimum distance as MDClat.
* **Relative Direction and Lanelet Context:** The provided lanelet information is crucial. Obstacles in different lanelets pose less immediate risk unless they're merging or crossing. The relative orientation is also important.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3041.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet (223) as the ego vehicle and relatively close.  Approximate calculations suggest a small MDClong.  MDClat is also small as both vehicles are in the same lane.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Based on the velocities, TTClong appears short.  The similar headings suggest the vehicles are on a near-collision course. TTClat is also short.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3044.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet (223) as the ego vehicle and very close.  MDClong and MDClat are both very small.  This is a critical situation.
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Given the proximity and velocities, TTClong is extremely short. The similar headings further increase the risk. TTClat is also very short.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3045.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet (223) and further away than 3044.0 but still poses a potential risk if 3044.0 is dealt with by braking.  MDClong is moderately small. MDClat is also small.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  TTClong is short, though not as immediate as with 3044.0. TTClat is also short.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3046.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Although this obstacle is in a different lanelet (127), its position and heading suggest it might be merging or crossing into the ego vehicle's path. More information about the road geometry is needed, but it warrants attention. MDClong and MDClat could be small depending on the trajectories.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The different lanelet and potential merging action make TTClong and TTClat assessment more complex, but the situation requires careful monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3047.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (2002).  While its lateral distance (MDClat) might be small, the different lanelet reduces immediate collision risk unless it is cutting across lanes. MDClong is moderately large.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The different lanelet and higher lateral separation imply a larger TTClat and TTClong.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
