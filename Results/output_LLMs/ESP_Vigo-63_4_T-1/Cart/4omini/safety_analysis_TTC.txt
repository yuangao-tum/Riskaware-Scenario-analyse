Safety analysis for the last timestep (8.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 8.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Identify obstacles in the same lanelet or trajectory as the ego vehicle:
1. **Obstacle 3041.0** is in lanelet 223.0 (Same lanelet)
2. **Obstacle 3044.0** is in lanelet 223.0 (Same lanelet)
3. **Obstacle 3045.0** is in lanelet 223.0 (Same lanelet)
4. **Obstacle 3046.0** is in lanelet 127.0 (Different lanelet - Ignore)
5. **Obstacle 3047.0** is in lanelet 2002.0 (Different lanelet - Ignore)

### Calculations:
To analyze the risks, we will calculate the Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) for obstacles 3041.0, 3044.0, and 3045.0.

**Ego Vehicle Specs:**
- Position: (416.4499, -158.0933)
- Velocity: 6.9567 m/s

**Obstacle 3041.0 Specs:**
- Position: (380.3463, -141.6225)
- Velocity: 8.15 m/s

Calculating relative vector components for 3041.0:
- Distance (x): 380.3463 - 416.4499 = -36.1036
- Distance (y): -141.6225 - (-158.0933) = 16.4708
- Direct distance to obstacle (MDC): 
  - MDC = √((-36.1036)^2 + (16.4708)^2) = 39.66 m
- Relative velocities:
  - Velocity Difference (x): 8.15 - 6.9567 = 1.1933 
  - Calculate TTC using distance and relative velocity:
  - Longitudinal TTC = Distance (x) / (Relative Velocity): TTC_long = -36.1036 / 1.1933 = -30.23 seconds (negative value indicating moving away)
  
**Obstacle 3044.0 Specs:**
- Position: (420.7739, -160.0651)
- Velocity: 7.9132 m/s

Calculating for 3044.0:
- Distance (x): 420.7739 - 416.4499 = 4.3240
- Distance (y): -160.0651 - (-158.0933) = -1.9718
- Direct distance to obstacle (MDC): 
  - MDC = √((4.3240)^2 + (-1.9718)^2) = 4.8234 m
- Relative velocities:
  - Velocity Difference (x): 7.9132 - 6.9567 = 0.9565 
  - Longitudinal TTC = Distance (x) / (Relative Velocity): TTC_long = 4.3240 / 0.9565 = 4.52 seconds
  
**Obstacle 3045.0 Specs:**
- Position: (434.837, -166.4946)
- Velocity: 7.8876 m/s

Calculating for 3045.0:
- Distance (x): 434.837 - 416.4499 = 18.3871
- Distance (y): -166.4946 - (-158.0933) = -8.4013
- Direct distance to obstacle (MDC): 
  - MDC = √((18.3871)^2 + (-8.4013)^2) = 20.37 m
- Relative velocities:
  - Velocity Difference (x): 7.8876 - 6.9567 = 0.9309
  - Longitudinal TTC = Distance (x) / (Relative Velocity): TTC_long = 18.3871 / 0.9309 = 19.73 seconds


### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 3041.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Moving further away, high negative distance indicating no immediate threat.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: Negative TTC indicates that the ego is moving away from this obstacle.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 3044.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Close distance but obstacle velocity allows some comfort.
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: TTC shows 4.52 seconds well within a manageable response window.
   - Time safety score: 4
   - Overall Risk score: 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 3045.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Moderate distance but fast approach of obstacle indicates need for caution.
   - Distance safety score: 3
   - Time Risk reason: Long TTC of 19.73 seconds suggests time available to maneuver.
   - Time safety score: 4
   - Overall Risk score: 4
