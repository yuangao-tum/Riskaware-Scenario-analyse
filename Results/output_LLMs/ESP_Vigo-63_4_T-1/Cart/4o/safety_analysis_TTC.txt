Safety analysis for the last timestep (8.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 8.3: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**Obstacle ID: 3041.0**

- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet and relatively close in terms of position. The minimum distance to collision (MDC) is relatively small because of the proximity of positions.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: Both ego and obstacle are traveling in the same lanelet with a small velocity difference. TTC is moderate, providing some time to react.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

---

**Obstacle ID: 3044.0**

- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is slightly ahead and closer to the ego vehicle with a small MDC due to similar lane positioning and direction.
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocities and positions suggest a close proximity, requiring prompt attention. The TTC could result in a quick closing of distance.
- **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

---

**Obstacle ID: 3045.0**

- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is further ahead than obstacle 3044.0, posing a smaller immediate risk due to increased MDC.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: With a velocity slightly higher than that of the ego vehicle and further ahead, the TTC in both directions is ample, providing sufficient reaction time.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

---

**Obstacle ID: 3046.0**

- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in a different lanelet, the possibility of immediate collision is null at the moment.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: Given the different lanelet location and higher speed, there's little to no interaction expected in immediate timeframes.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

---

**Obstacle ID: 3047.0**

- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned significantly far and in another lanelet, making any immediate collision impossible.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: Due to the different lanelet and current position far from the ego vehicle, the TTC is not a concern.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
