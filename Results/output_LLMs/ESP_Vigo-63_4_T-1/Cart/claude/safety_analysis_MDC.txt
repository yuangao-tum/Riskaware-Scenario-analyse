Safety analysis for the last timestep (8.3 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario for potential collisions:

### Detailed Safety Analysis:

1. Obstacle ID: 3041
- Distance Risk: Moderate risk as the obstacle is in lanelet 223 with ego vehicle, but maintaining safe lateral distance
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk: Acceptable longitudinal separation, different travel speeds but controlled
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

2. Obstacle ID: 3044
- Distance Risk: Higher risk due to being in same lanelet 223 and closer proximity
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk: Moderate risk due to similar travel direction but different speeds
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

3. Obstacle ID: 3045
- Distance Risk: Moderate risk, sharing lanelet 223 but maintaining safer distance
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk: Low risk due to controlled speed differential
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

4. Obstacle ID: 3043
- Distance Risk: Low risk as operating in different lanelet (127)
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk: Minimal risk due to separate trajectories
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

5. Obstacle ID: 3046
- Distance Risk: Low risk as in different lanelet (127)
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk: Minimal risk due to separate paths
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

6. Obstacle ID: 3047
- Distance Risk: Very low risk due to significant separation
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk: Minimal risk due to different trajectories
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Key Risk Factors:
1. Multiple vehicles in shared lanelet 223
2. Varying vehicle speeds
3. Lateral positioning within lanes

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

No vehicles present immediate collision risk (score 0) or extreme risk (score 1). The lowest risk score observed is 3, indicating moderate but manageable risk levels. The scenario shows controlled traffic flow with adequate safety margins maintained between vehicles.
