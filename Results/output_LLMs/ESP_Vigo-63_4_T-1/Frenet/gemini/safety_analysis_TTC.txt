### Safety analysis for timestep 8.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3041.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is 35.18m ahead longitudinally and poses no immediate lateral risk. It's moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is moving away, minimizing collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3044.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is very close behind (-0.24m) and longitudinally aligned, representing an extremely high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Extremely short distance suggests imminent collision. While relative acceleration might help avoid impact, the proximity signifies extreme risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 3045.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind (-15.71m) and longitudinally aligned. While not immediately colliding, the closing distance presents a high risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is closing in, increasing collision risk. Though some distance remains, the closing speed warrants concern.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 3046.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind and to the right, with significant lateral and longitudinal separation.  It's moving further away both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The increasing separation signifies no immediate time-related collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3047.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind with substantial longitudinal separation and moving away.  
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Increasing separation eliminates time-related risks.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
