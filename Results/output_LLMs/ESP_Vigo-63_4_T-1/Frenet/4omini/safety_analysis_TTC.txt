### Safety analysis for timestep 8.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 3041.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance to the obstacle is 35.18 m, which is a significant gap, and there is no lateral offset (0.0 m). Therefore, the minimal distance poses a low risk as the vehicle is not in immediate danger of collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: With a relative velocity of 1.19 m/s and a distance of 35.18 m, the Time to Collision (TTC) can be calculated as TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity = 35.18 m / 1.19 m/s ≈ 29.5 seconds. This indicates a significant amount of time before a potential collision occurs.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (average of distance and time)

- **Obstacle ID: 3044.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is -0.24 m, which means the obstacle is extremely close and approaching from behind. The lateral distance is also 0.0 m, indicating high proximity and a collision danger.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is 0.96 m/s. The TTC can be calculated as TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity = -0.24 m / 0.96 m/s ≈ -0.25 seconds (approaching). This indicates an imminent risk of collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 1
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (average of distance and time)

- **Obstacle ID: 3045.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is -15.71 m, indicating the obstacle is approaching from behind. The lateral distance is also 0.0 m, demonstrating a close range and possible danger of a rear-end collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is 0.93 m/s. The TTC can be calculated as TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity = -15.71 m / 0.93 m/s ≈ -16.9 seconds (approaching). This means the obstacle is on a collision path.
  - **Time safety score**: 1
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (average of distance and time)

- **Obstacle ID: 3046.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is -28.53 m and lateral distance is -54.17 m, indicating that the obstacle is on a collision course in the rear-right direction. The significant distance increases the overall safety from direct impact.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is -6.36 m/s (moving away), which creates a negative TTC scenario as the obstacle is receding. 
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (average of distance and time)
  
- **Obstacle ID: 3047.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is -31.76 m, indicating that the obstacle is far behind the ego vehicle by a significant margin, with a 0.0 m lateral distance. This further mitigates the risk of collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is -6.51 m/s (moving away), which renders the TTC calculation irrelevant since the obstacle is effectively moving away from the ego vehicle.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (average of distance and time)
