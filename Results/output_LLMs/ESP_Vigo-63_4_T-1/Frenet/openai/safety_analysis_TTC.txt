### Safety analysis for timestep 8.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 3041.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 35.18 m and lateral distance is 0.0 m, indicating a significant gap with the obstacle moving away. Therefore, the collision risk is low.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity longitudinally is 1.19 m/s and the obstacle is moving away. The time to collision (TTC) is long due to the distance and diminishing relative velocity.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 3044.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is -0.24 m, which indicates the obstacle is very close behind the ego vehicle. This presents a high risk of collision.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity of 0.96 m/s towards the ego car means the risk of a collision is high and immediate.
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 3045.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is -15.71 m, also indicating the obstacle is very close and likely poses danger due to its proximity.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: With a relative velocity of 0.93 m/s towards the ego vehicle, the risk of collision remains significant and urgent.
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 3046.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is -28.53 m and the lateral distance is -54.17 m. It is at a considerable distance with both components indicating some risk but still manageable.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: This obstacle is moving away, indicating a lower collision risk despite the closeness. The relative velocity suggests minimal immediate threat.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 3047.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is -31.76 m with the obstacle behind. This indicates a risk of impending collision due to close proximity.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is reversing towards the ego vehicle with a relative velocity of -6.51 m/s, creating an urgent situation.
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)
