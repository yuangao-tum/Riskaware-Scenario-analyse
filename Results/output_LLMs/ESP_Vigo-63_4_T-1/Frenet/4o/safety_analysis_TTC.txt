### Safety analysis for timestep 8.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3041.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is 35.18 meters in front of the ego vehicle and moving away with a relative velocity of 1.19 m/s in the longitudinal direction. There is no lateral offset.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Given the positive relative velocity, the obstacle is moving away, indicating no immediate risk of collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3044.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is -0.24 meters behind the ego vehicle, indicating extremely close proximity. Although there is no lateral offset, the longitudinal proximity signifies a high risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: With a low positive relative velocity of 0.96 m/s, the vehicle is approaching the ego car rapidly, leading to a substantial risk of collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 3045.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: At 15.71 meters behind with a low relative velocity of 0.93 m/s, although there is no lateral offset, it indicates a potential for less immediate collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity and acceleration indicate the obstacle is approaching but gives some time for reaction.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3046.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away both longitudinally and laterally (28.53 m and 54.17 m, respectively).
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The high negative relative velocities signify that the obstacle's path is diverging from the ego car, implying no risk of collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3047.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned 31.76 meters behind and moving away with a negative velocity.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The negative velocities indicate that the obstacle is not an immediate threat and is moving away.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5
