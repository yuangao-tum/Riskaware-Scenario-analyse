Safety analysis for timestep 8.3 seconds:
``` 
### Safety analysis for timestep 8.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- Obstacle ID: 3041
  - Relative Direction: Front
  - Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance of 35.18 m indicates negligible risk as the obstacle is moving away. Lateral distance is 0.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5 (wdominant = 1)
  - Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal time is infinity, indicating negligible risk. Lateral time is 0, indicating a collision risk.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 5 (wdominant = 1)
  - Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3044
  - Relative Direction: Behind
  - Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance of 0.24 m and lateral distance of 0.0 m indicate extreme risk due to high proximity from behind.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1 (wdominant = 1)
  - Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal time of 0.26 seconds implies extreme risk, given the close distance behind.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 1 (wdominant = 1)
  - Overall Risk Score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 3045
  - Relative Direction: Behind
  - Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance of 15.71 m indicates negligible risk since the obstacle is significantly distant behind. Lateral distance is 0.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5 (wdominant = 1)
  - Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal time of 16.88 seconds suggests negligible risk.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 5 (wdominant = 1)
  - Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3046
  - Relative Direction: Rear-right
  - Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance of 28.53 m and lateral distance of 54.17 m signify negligible risk, as obstacle is moving away.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5 (wdominant = 0.5)
  - Time Risk Reason: Both longitudinal and lateral times are infinity, indicating negligible risk for both directions.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 5 (wdominant = 0.5)
  - Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3047
  - Relative Direction: Behind
  - Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance of 31.76 m is negligible risk, with no lateral distance.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5 (wdominant = 1)
  - Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal time being infinity indicates negligible risk.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 5 (wdominant = 1)
  - Overall Risk Score: 5
