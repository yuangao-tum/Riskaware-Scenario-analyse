Safety analysis for timestep 8.3 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 8.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 3041
- **Relative Direction:** Front
- **Distance Risk Reason:** The longitudinal distance (35.18) is quite substantial, indicating minimal risk, but the lateral distance is at 0.0, indicating an overlap with the ego car's path.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 0  
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** DSC = (5 * 1) + (0 * 0) = 5
- **Time Risk Reason:** The longitudinal time to collision is infinity suggesting no immediate risk, but the lateral time is 0.0 which indicates an overlap.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 0  
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** TSC = (5 * 1) + (0 * 0) = 5
- **Overall Risk Score:** Risk Score = 0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 5 = 5

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 3044
- **Relative Direction:** Behind
- **Distance Risk Reason:** The longitudinal distance (0.24) is very close, indicating a high risk of collision, while the lateral distance is 0.0 indicating direct alignment.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 2  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 0  
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** DSC = (2 * 1) + (0 * 0) = 2
- **Time Risk Reason:** The time to collision is very short (0.26) indicating a high risk of collision and the lateral time is also 0.0 implying alignment with the ego car's path.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 2  
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 0  
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** TSC = (2 * 1) + (0 * 0) = 2
- **Overall Risk Score:** Risk Score = 0.5 * 2 + 0.5 * 2 = 2

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 3045
- **Relative Direction:** Behind
- **Distance Risk Reason:** The longitudinal distance (15.71) indicates that the obstacle is relatively far away, with a lateral distance of 0.0 indicating alignment.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 4  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 0  
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** DSC = (4 * 1) + (0 * 0) = 4
- **Time Risk Reason:** The time to collision (16.88) indicates that there is enough time until a potential collision occurs, but the lateral time is 0.0 suggesting an alignment.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 4  
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 0  
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** TSC = (4 * 1) + (0 * 0) = 4
- **Overall Risk Score:** Risk Score = 0.5 * 4 + 0.5 * 4 = 4

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 3046
- **Relative Direction:** Rear-right
- **Distance Risk Reason:** The longitudinal distance (28.53) indicates a manageable distance, and the lateral distance (54.17) suggests safety on that axis.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 5  
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** DSC = (5 * 0.5) + (5 * 0.5) = 5
- **Time Risk Reason:** Both the longitudinal and lateral time to collision are infinity which indicates no risk from this obstacle in any direction.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 5  
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** TSC = (5 * 0.5) + (5 * 0.5) = 5
- **Overall Risk Score:** Risk Score = 0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 5 = 5

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 3047
- **Relative Direction:** Behind
- **Distance Risk Reason:** The longitudinal distance (31.76) is safe, but the lateral distance is 0.0 indicating alignment with the ego car's path.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 0  
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** DSC = (5 * 1) + (0 * 0) = 5
- **Time Risk Reason:** The longitudinal time to collision is infinity, suggesting there is no impending collision, yet the lateral time is 0.0 indicating an alignment.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 0  
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** TSC = (5 * 1) + (0 * 0) = 5
- **Overall Risk Score:** Risk Score = 0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 5 = 5
