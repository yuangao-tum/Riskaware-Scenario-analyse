Safety analysis for timestep 8.3 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 8.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3041
- Relative Direction: Front
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 35.18 (> 5), indicating negligible risk longitudinally. DTClat is 0.0 (= 0), indicating a collision risk laterally.  Since the relative direction is front, longitudinal distance is dominant.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is Infinity (> 5), indicating negligible risk longitudinally. TTClat is 0.0 (= 0), indicating a collision risk laterally. Since the relative direction is front, longitudinal time is dominant.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3044
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0.24 (<= 0.5), indicating extreme risk longitudinally. DTClat is 0.0 (= 0), indicating a collision risk laterally. Since the relative direction is behind, longitudinal distance is dominant.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 1
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.26 (<= 0.5), indicating extreme risk longitudinally. TTClat is 0.0 (= 0), indicating a collision risk laterally. Since the relative direction is behind, longitudinal time is dominant.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 1
- Overall Risk Score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 3045
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 15.71 (> 5), indicating negligible risk longitudinally. DTClat is 0.0 (= 0), indicating a collision risk laterally. Since the relative direction is behind, longitudinal distance is dominant.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 16.88 (> 5), indicating negligible risk longitudinally. TTClat is 0.0 (= 0), indicating a collision risk laterally. Since the relative direction is behind, longitudinal time is dominant.
