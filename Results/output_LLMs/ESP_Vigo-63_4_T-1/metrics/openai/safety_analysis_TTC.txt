Safety analysis for timestep 8.3 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 8.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3041
- Relative Direction: Front
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance to collision is ample (35.18), and lateral distance is zero (0.0), indicating an immediate risk of lateral collision.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0  
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 2.5  
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal time to collision is infinite, and lateral time is zero (0.0), which reflects a significant chance of collision.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5  
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0  
- Overall Time Safety Score: 2.5  
- Overall Risk Score: 3

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3044
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance is very close (0.24) and lateral distance is zero (0.0), indicating an immediate risk of collision from the back.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0  
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.5  
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal time to collision is very short (0.26) and lateral time is zero (0.0), indicating an immediate risk of collision from the back.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1  
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0  
- Overall Time Safety Score: 0.5  
- Overall Risk Score: 0

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3045
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance to collision is acceptable (15.71) with zero lateral distance indicating no immediate risk of collision, thus low safety score.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0  
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 2  
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal time to collision is sufficient (16.88), and lateral time is zero (0.0), indicating zero safety on lateral collision.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4  
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0  
- Overall Time Safety Score: 2  
- Overall Risk Score: 2

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3046
- Relative Direction: Rear-right
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance is large (28.53) and lateral distance is significant (54.17), indicating no risk of collision as the object is moving away.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5  
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5  
- Time Risk Reason: Both longitudinal and lateral time to collision are infinite, reiterating that there is no risk of collision.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5  
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5  
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5  
- Overall Risk Score: 5
