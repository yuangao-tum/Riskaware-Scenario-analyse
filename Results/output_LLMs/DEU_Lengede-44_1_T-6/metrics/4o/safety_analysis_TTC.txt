Safety analysis for timestep 6.9 seconds:
```markdown
### Safety analysis for timestep 6.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 2
  - Relative Direction: Front-left
  - Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance of 124.88 and lateral distance of 260.75 represent a negligible risk as they are greater than 5.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal time to collision of 13.94 indicates a negligible risk as it's greater than 5; no lateral collision time as it's infinity.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3
  - Relative Direction: Front-left
  - Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance of 143.01 and lateral distance of 196.11 represent a negligible risk as they are greater than 5.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal time to collision of 15.96 indicates a negligible risk as it's greater than 5; no lateral collision time as it's infinity.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 4
  - Relative Direction: Front-left
