### Safety analysis for timestep 6.9: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 2.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance (124.88 m) is considerable and lateral distance (260.75 m) is also significant. 
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC = DTClong / |Vrel_long| = 124.88 / 8.96 ≈ 13.93 sec, indicating adequate time to react.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Similar conditions to obstacle 2.0 with sufficient longitudinal and lateral distances.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC = 143.01 / 8.96 ≈ 15.95 sec, good time for reaction.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 4.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance (89.76 m) starts to get closer, lateral distance (108.81 m) still permits adjustment.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC = 89.76 / 8.95 ≈ 10.02 sec, providing reasonable reaction time.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 45.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Extremely close longitudinal distance (10.53 m) and lateral distance (2.85 m) heightens the potential risk significantly.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC is critically low with significant negative relative velocity indicating immediate collision risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 1
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 61.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance (42.52 m) and lateral distance (5.11 m) are too close with movement toward the ego car.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC = 42.52 / 40.6 ≈ 1.05 sec indicates imminent collision risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 1
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 83.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance (93.46 m) and lateral distance (52.03 m) suggest a manageable situation.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC = 93.46 / 8.65 ≈ 10.78 sec, giving time to react properly.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Summary in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "null",
        "OverallRiskScore": "null"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "45.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
```
This detailed analysis indicates that there are obstacles posing extreme risks due to their proximity and relative velocity towards the ego vehicle. All other obstacles present a manageable risk with adequate time and distance to react.
