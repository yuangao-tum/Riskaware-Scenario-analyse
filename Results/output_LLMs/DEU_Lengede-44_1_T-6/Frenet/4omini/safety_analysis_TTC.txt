### Safety analysis for timestep 6.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 45.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance is only 10.53 m and lateral distance is 2.85 m. This indicates a very close proximity between the ego vehicle and the obstacle.
  - Distance safety score: 0
  - Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal velocity is -42.31 m/s, indicating a high speed towards the ego vehicle. Given that the distance is so small, a collision is imminent.
  - Time safety score: 0
  - Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 61.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance is 42.52 m and lateral distance is 5.11 m, indicating a close distance that poses a serious risk.
  - Distance safety score: 1
  - Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal velocity is -40.6 m/s. Given the proximity, there is a significant risk of a collision in a short time frame.
  - Time safety score: 1
  - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 63.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 71.26 m and lateral distance is 15.96 m, which suggests moderate closeness.
  - Distance safety score: 2
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal speed of -32.78 m/s indicates that it is approaching faster, increasing the likelihood of collision.
  - Time safety score: 2
  - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 87.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 62.48 m and lateral distance is 6.64 m, suggesting significant but manageable distance.
  - Distance safety score: 3
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity of -2.34 m/s indicates a slow closing speed, allowing for some time to react.
  - Time safety score: 3
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 92.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 119.78 m and lateral distance is 290.32 m, demonstrating a safe distance.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity does not indicate an immediate threat and provides ample time to react.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 4

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "45",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "61",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

### Summary:
- Obstacle 45 poses an immediate collision risk with an overall score of 0 due to its extremely close proximity and high speed convergence.
- Obstacle 61 has a high collision risk, rated as extreme, with an overall score of 1. 
- Additional obstacles range from low to medium risk scores, indicating they are manageable with sufficient reaction time. Tasks should prioritize addressing those with extreme and collision risks immediately.
