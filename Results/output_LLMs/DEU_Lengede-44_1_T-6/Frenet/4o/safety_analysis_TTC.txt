### Safety analysis for timestep 6.9: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 2.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: With a longitudinal distance of 124.88m and a lateral distance of 260.75m, the obstacle is relatively far from the ego vehicle. Even though it is moving towards the ego vehicle, the current distance is safe.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Considering a longitudinal relative velocity of -8.96 m/s, the calculated TTC is about 13.93 seconds (124.88 / 8.96). The vehicle has ample time to react.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned 143.01m longitudinally and 196.11m laterally, this obstacle is even further away and not an immediate threat.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: With a longitudinal speed of -8.96 m/s, the TTC is approximately 15.97 seconds (143.01 / 8.96).
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 4.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The lateral distance of 108.81m is substantial. Although the longitudinal distance is 89.76 m, it is still safe for the current conditions.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: At a longitudinal velocity of -8.95 m/s, the TTC is around 10.03 seconds (89.76 / 8.95).
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 7.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Located 140.07m longitudinally and 203.01m laterally, indicating no immediate collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: With the relative velocity, the TTC is calculated as approximately 15.63 seconds (140.07 / 8.96).
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 45.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: At a longitudinal distance of only 10.53m and lateral distance of 2.85m, this obstacle is dangerously close.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's high relative velocity toward the ego car results in a TTC of 0.25 seconds (10.53 / 42.31).
  - **Time safety score**: 1
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 61.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: With the obstacle being 42.52m longitudinally and 5.11m laterally, it's more concerning due to high velocities.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Given its high longitudinal relative speed toward the ego car, the TTC is roughly 1.05 seconds (42.52 / 40.6).
  - **Time safety score**: 2
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 109.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Extremely close with a longitudinal distance of -0.2 m (indicating backing contact), high concern.
  - **Distance safety score**: 0
  - **Time Risk reason**: Since it's already in contact, TTC is 0.
  - **Time safety score**: 0
  - **Overall Risk score**: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 110.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Being only longitudinally far with minor lateral offset will lead to a collision soon given high relative speed.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1
  - **Time Risk reason**: A TTC close to 1.11 seconds calculated from the relative longitudinal velocity indicates danger.
  - **Time safety score**: 1
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1
