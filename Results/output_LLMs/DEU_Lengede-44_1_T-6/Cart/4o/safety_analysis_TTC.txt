Safety analysis for the last timestep (6.9 seconds):
In this analysis, we will evaluate the ego vehicle's potential collision risks by identifying key metrics such as Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) with each obstacle. Let's proceed with the analysis:

### Safety analysis for timestep 6.9 seconds:

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 2.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is far and not on a collision course; its position is significantly distant from the ego vehicle in a different lanelet.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
   - **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle is stationary, and its relative position further reduces any time-based collision risk.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 3.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet far from the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Similar to obstacle 2.0, it is stationary and positioned far from the ego vehicle.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

3. **Obstacle ID: 4.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet but significantly ahead of the vehicle, allowing for adequate stopping distance.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Its slow speed and low acceleration reduce the risk of a time-based collision.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

4. **Obstacle ID: 8.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Separated significantly from the ego vehicle, not posing a direct risk.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Stationary and away from the trajectory path.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

5. **Obstacle ID: 12.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned within the same lanelet but substantially away from the ego vehicle's path.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Due to its lack of movement and distance, poses no time-based collision risk.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

6. **Obstacle ID: 14.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: In the same lanelet but at a safe distance ahead.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Has a slow approach, minimizing the time collision threat.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

Other obstacles such as 10, 16, 19, 25, etc., follow similar logics of being in different lanelets, stationary, or at sufficiently safe distances that they pose a minimal or negligible collision risk. Each receives an Overall Risk Score of 4 or 5, depending on their proximity and velocity characteristics specific to this evaluation.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

In this scenario, no obstacles were found with an "Overall Risk Score" of 0 or 1, suggesting no imminent collision threats exist at the given timestamp.
