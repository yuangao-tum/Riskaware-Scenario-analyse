Safety analysis for the last timestep (6.9 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 6.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Ego Vehicle Position:** (85.8805, -229.1091)  
**Velocity:** 8.9582

Relevant to the Ego vehicle position and its trajectory, we’ll identify the obstacles in the same lanelet (522.0) and analyze their relative positions to calculate the TTC and MDC.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### 1. Obstacle ID: 4.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned at (38.9795, -91.707), this obstacle is ahead on the same lanelet (522.0). The distance is manageable with proper maneuvers.
- **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** The computed TTC indicates that the vehicle would reach this position soon, but not immediately. Hence, manageable.
- **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 3

#### 2. Obstacle ID: 14.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle located at (60.5597, -102.8141), which is in proximity to the Ego vehicle’s path in lanelet 522. 
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** The vehicle is approaching, but with a decent buffer. The vehicle will not collide imminently.
- **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

#### 3. Obstacle ID: 44.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located at (17.2218, -62.103), it presents a lateral risk. 
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** No immediate collision risk as the vehicle is moving in the opposite direction.
- **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

#### 4. Obstacle ID: 76.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Situated at (99.6076, -126.0803), well off the direct path but needs observation.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** Moving towards the obstacle, but would require significant lateral movement.
- **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

#### 5. Obstacle ID: 81.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** At (107.519, -137.6927), it poses a longer distance risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** Similar to the previous obstacles, this one will not cause immediate collision concerns.
- **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

#### 6. Obstacle ID: 109.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** This is at (83.0067, -232.8745), quite close but on a different path.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** While moving towards, it gives enough time to react.
- **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 4
