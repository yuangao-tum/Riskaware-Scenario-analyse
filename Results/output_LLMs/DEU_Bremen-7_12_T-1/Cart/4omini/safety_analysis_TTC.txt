Safety analysis for the last timestep (6.8 seconds):
To analyze the potential collision risks between the ego vehicle and various obstacles in the provided scenario, we begin with identifying which obstacles could collide with the ego vehicle based on their positions, velocities, and orientations. 

### Steps Overview:
1. **Identify Relevant Obstacles**: We will focus on obstacles that are in close proximity or have similar trajectories/directions to the ego vehicle.
2. **Calculate Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**: This will be determined by the Euclidean distance between the ego vehicle and each obstacle.
3. **Calculate Time to Collision (TTC)**: This will be assessed considering both longitudinal and lateral component velocities.

### Ego Vehicle Information:
- **Position**: (104.2257, 309.5009)
- **Velocity**: 0.436 m/s (decelerating at -0.3847)
- **Orientation**: -0.557 (indicating direction of travel)

### Obstacle Information:
- We will calculate MDC and TTC for each obstacle based on their current positions, velocities, and orientations.
