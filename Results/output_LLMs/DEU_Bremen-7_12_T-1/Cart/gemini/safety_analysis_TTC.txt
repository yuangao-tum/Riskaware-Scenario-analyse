Safety analysis for the last timestep (6.8 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 6.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories and shapes of obstacles and ego vehicle aren't given,  I make some assumptions for illustrative purposes.  I assume a rectangular bounding box around each vehicle and  TTC/DTC calculations are based on center points and velocity vectors projected along the longitudinal and lateral axes relative to the ego vehicle.  A more sophisticated analysis would require additional data (vehicle dimensions, precise trajectories, road geometry).

**General Observations:**

The ego vehicle is in lanelet 912. Several obstacles are nearby in different lanelets. Obstacles in lanelets 1841-1844 appear to be in adjacent lanes moving in opposing directions.  Obstacles in lanelets 395 and 553 are potentially approaching from behind. Obstacles 30305, 30306, 30307, and 30309 are also moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle and in the same or adjacent lanelets.
