### Safety analysis for timestep 6.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**General Notes:**  For lateral TTC and MDC calculations, if the lateral velocity is close to zero, we assume a very large TTC to avoid division by zero and consider the lateral distance as the MDC. If an obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally (positive relative velocity), TTC is considered infinite and not a risk.
