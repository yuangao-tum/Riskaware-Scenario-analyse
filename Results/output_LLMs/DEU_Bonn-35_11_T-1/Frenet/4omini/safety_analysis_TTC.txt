### Safety analysis for timestep 3.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID**: 30190.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 83.22 m (longitudinally close), lateral distance is 68.74 m (safe laterally).
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk).
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal relative velocity is -9.08 m/s, indicating a high speed nearing collision. TTC = 83.22 / 9.08 = 9.16 seconds, which indicates sufficient time to react.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk).
  - Overall Risk score: 4.

- **Obstacle ID**: 30191.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 86.89 m (safe), no lateral distance.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk).
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal relative velocity is -7.65 m/s, leading to TTC = 86.89 / 7.65 = 11.36 seconds, providing a good reaction time.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk).
  - Overall Risk score: 4.

- **Obstacle ID**: 30192.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 65.48 m and lateral is 4.09 m; lateral proximity is very close.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk).
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal relative velocity is 3.48 m/s, meaning the ego vehicle is moving away. Hence, no collision risk. TTC is irrelevant.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk).
  - Overall Risk score: 4.

- **Obstacle ID**: 30193.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 84.99 m approaching, lateral distance is 33.6 m.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk).
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal relative velocity is -7.33 m/s. TTC = 84.99 / 7.33 = 11.6 seconds indicates sufficient time for evasive action.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk).
  - Overall Risk score: 3.

- **Obstacle ID**: 30194.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 87.47 m and lateral distance is 40.46 m (safe).
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk).
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal relative velocity is -8.88 m/s. TTC = 87.47 / 8.88 = 9.83 seconds, indicating sufficient reaction time.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk).
  - Overall Risk score: 4.

- **Obstacle ID**: 30195.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 98.5 m (safe), no lateral proximity.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk).
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal relative velocity is -7.65 m/s. TTC = 98.5 / 7.65 = 12.87 seconds, providing a large window to react.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk).
  - Overall Risk score: 4.

- **Obstacle ID**: 30196.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 31.53 m (close), and lateral is very close at 0.42 m.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk).
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal relative velocity is 6.34 m/s. Since the obstacle is moving away, TTC is not a concern for this obstacle.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk).
  - Overall Risk score: 3.

- **Obstacle ID**: 30197.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is -18.69 m (behind), safe laterally.
  - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk).
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal relative velocity is -7.65 m/s with TTC being irrelevant since it's behind.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk).
  - Overall Risk score: 5.

- **Obstacle ID**: 30198.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance 80.74 m, laterally near at 61.65 m.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk).
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal relative velocity is -6.17 m/s. TTC = 80.74 / 6.17 = 13.06 seconds.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk).
  - Overall Risk score: 3.

- **Obstacle ID**: 30200.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Exact alignment with ego vehicle (colliding).
  - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk).
  - Time Risk reason: No time to react; collision is imminent.
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk).
  - Overall Risk score: 1.

- **Obstacle ID**: 30201.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is -18.69 m (behind).
  - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk).
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal relative velocity is 4.76 m/s. Since it's behind, there's no collision risk.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk).
  - Overall Risk score: 5.
