### Safety analysis for timestep 3.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30190.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively far away (83.22m longitudinal, 68.74m lateral) and moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching longitudinally but relatively far, lateral movement is away.  TTC calculation would depend on ego vehicle's intended path, but currently safe.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30191.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately far (86.89m longitudinal, 24.93m lateral), but no lateral movement.  Requires monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally. TTC calculation needed, but poses some risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30192.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close (65.48m longitudinal, 4.09m lateral). Lateral movement is away. 
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, further reducing risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30193.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively far (84.99m longitudinal, 33.6m lateral), but converging both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Converging movement increases risk over time. TTC calculation is important.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30194.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far (87.47m longitudinal, 40.46m lateral) and moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching longitudinally but relatively far, lateral movement is away.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30195.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Far (98.5m longitudinal, 5.17m lateral) and no lateral movement.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally but far.  
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30196.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Close (31.53m longitudinal, 0.42m lateral).  High risk due to proximity.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, mitigating the risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30197.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Far (104.76m longitudinal, 22.79m lateral) and no lateral movement.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching longitudinally but far.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


**- Obstacle ID: 30198.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far (80.74m longitudinal, 61.65m lateral) but converging both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Converging movement increases risk over time.  TTC is crucial.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


**- Obstacle ID: 30200.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Collision imminent (0m longitudinal, 0m lateral).
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Collision imminent.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 30201.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Behind the ego vehicle (-18.69m longitudinal, 0m lateral), not an immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching from behind, but not necessarily dangerous. Relative speed is moderate.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
