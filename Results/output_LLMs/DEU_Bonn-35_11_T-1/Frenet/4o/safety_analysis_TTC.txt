### Safety Analysis for Timestep 3.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30190.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is 83.22m longitudinally and 68.74m laterally positioned. The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally but moving away laterally.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle's relative longitudinal velocity is -9.08 m/s which indicates it's moving towards the ego car. TTC is relatively large given the speed and distance, decreasing concern in lateral movement.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30191.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned 86.89m longitudinally and 24.93m laterally. It’s moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally with no lateral movement.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk Reason**: With a velocity of -7.65 m/s, the obstacle is approaching, but the distance allows ample TTC.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30192.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle is 65.48m longitudinally and 4.09m laterally but is moving away in both directions.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Although closer, the velocity is moving away longitudinally (3.48 m/s) which offers increasing TTC.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30193.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned 84.99m longitudinally and 33.6m laterally. It is moving toward the ego vehicle in both directions.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Has a velocity of -7.33 m/s longitudinally and -1.9 m/s laterally. Although the obstacle is approaching, the time until a potential collision is moderate.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30194.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: With 87.47m longitudinally and 40.46m laterally, moving away laterally coordinates with low immediate risk.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk Reason**: The longitudinal relative velocity of -8.88 m/s needs monitoring for TTC, albeit the obstacle is not closing in rapidly enough for major risk.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30195.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned 98.5m longitudinally and 5.17m laterally. No lateral relative motion means lateral displacement isn’t considerable.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Although the obstacle is approaching with -7.65 m/s longitudinally, there is plenty of time before potential collision.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30196.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Dangerously close at 31.53m longitudinally and 0.42m laterally. However, it's moving away in both directions.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk Reason**: The positive velocity indicates movement away from the ego car, reducing short-term tension.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30197.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned 104.76m longitudinally and 22.79m laterally with no lateral relative motion.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Displacement and velocity combination give a high TTC leading to a negligible initial risk.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30198.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Observably with 80.74m and 61.65m distance moving toward longitudinally and laterally, but not prominently.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Relative velocity suggests an intricate TTC calculation for both directions.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30200.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is at 0.0m both longitudinally and laterally, indicating an existing collision or contact.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 0 (Collision)
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Given zero distances and relative direction, collision is present or unavoidable.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 0 (Collision)
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 0 (Collision)

- **Obstacle ID: 30201.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is 18.69m behind lateral 0.0m, which typically provides enough buffer from immediate collision.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Even with its velocity at 4.76 m/s towards the ego, longitudinal reduction minimizes immediate concern.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
