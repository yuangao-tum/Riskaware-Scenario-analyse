### Safety analysis for timestep 3.7 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30190.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is 83.22 m (safe), but lateral movement toward the ego vehicle raises concerns due to the closing speed.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal TTC = 83.22 m / 9.08 m/s = 9.15 s, which indicates no immediate risk of collision since it is safe.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30191.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is 86.89 m (safe), no lateral movement, so itâ€™s manageable.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal TTC = 86.89 m / 7.65 m/s = 11.35 s, indicating no immediate risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30192.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Real distance is longitudinal 65.48 m and lateral 4.09 m. The lateral distance is critical as it is very close indicating a risk of obstacle interference.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3
  - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal TTC = 65.48 m / 3.48 m/s = 18.83 s, which provides a manageable risk horizon.
  - **Time safety score:** 4
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 30193.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Real distance of 84.99 m longitudinally and 33.6 m laterally are still safe, though there is longitudinal speed toward the ego which is a concern.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal TTC = 84.99 m / 7.33 m/s = 11.59 s which is acceptable.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30194.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance of 87.47 m (safe), but lateral movement may pose challenges.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal TTC = 87.47 m / 8.88 m/s = 9.84 s indicating a low risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30195.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is 98.5 m and lateral distance is sufficient; therefore low concern.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal TTC = 98.5 m / 7.65 m/s = 12.86 s, which is safe.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30196.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance of 31.53 m and very close lateral distance of 0.42 m indicates a potential crossing with high impact risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 2
  - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal TTC = 31.53 m / 6.34 m/s = 4.97 s indicates urgent consideration for action.
  - **Time safety score:** 3
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2

- **Obstacle ID:** 30197.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance of 104.76 m is distinctly safe, but relative velocity raises concerns.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal TTC = 104.76 m / 7.65 m/s = 13.71 s, indicating no immediate danger.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30198.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance of 80.74 m and lateral distance of 61.65 m imply control, though approach velocity is concerning.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal TTC = 80.74 m / 6.17 m/s = 13.07 s, which is moderate.
  - **Time safety score:** 4
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30200.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Direct collision risk (0.0 m) requires immediate action, hence collision risk is confirmed.
  - **Distance safety score:** 0
  - **Time Risk reason:** Immediate overlap suggests instant collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 0
  - **Overall Risk score:** 0

- **Obstacle ID:** 30201.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance of -18.69 m indicates the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle from behind, resulting in an immediate risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 2
  - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal TTC = -18.69 / 4.76 < 0 suggests that the obstacle is already occupying space within the ego vehicle's trajectory, indicating a high risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 1
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1
