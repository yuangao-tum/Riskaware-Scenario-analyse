Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories and dimensions of vehicles aren't provided, I'm making some assumptions for illustrative purposes.  I'll use a simplified collision check based on Euclidean distance and relative velocity/position.  A more robust analysis would involve shape intersection, accurate motion prediction, and consideration of lane boundaries.  I'm also assuming a safety "bubble" around the ego vehicle â€“ if an obstacle breaches this bubble, it's considered a higher risk.

**Calculations and Reasoning (Illustrative):**

We'll calculate approximate TTC and MDC based on the provided data.

* **TTC (longitudinal/lateral):**  Estimated by dividing the relative distance (along longitudinal or lateral axis) by the relative velocity. If the relative velocity is close to zero or moving away, TTC will be considered high (safe).
* **MDC:**  Calculated as the minimum Euclidean distance between ego and obstacle based on their current positions.

**Note:**  Without detailed trajectories and vehicle dimensions, these calculations are very approximate and serve mainly to demonstrate the analysis process.
