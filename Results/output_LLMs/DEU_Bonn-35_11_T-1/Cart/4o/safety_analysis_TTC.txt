Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.7 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30190**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is located in lanelet 899.0; it's moving away at a slight angle, creating a minor risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC indicates a negligible collision risk due to the obstacle's diverging path.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

2. **Obstacle ID: 30191**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: This stationary obstacle is far from the ego vehicle's path in lanelet 892.0.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: No time risk as the obstacle is stationary and off-path.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

3. **Obstacle ID: 30192**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Traveling in a different trajectory and lanelet 691.0, decreasing collision risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low overlap in the travel trajectories; no immediate collision detected.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

4. **Obstacle ID: 30193**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 1876.0 and not a threat; deviating trajectory.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Minimal movement; doesn't converge with the ego vehicle's path.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

5. **Obstacle ID: 30194**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In lanelet 899.0 and slightly moving towards the ego vehicle's path at proximity.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3
   - **Time Risk reason**: Medium risk of collision; needs monitoring due to trajectory alignment.
   - **Time safety score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

6. **Obstacle ID: 30195**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary in lanelet 45.0; not in an immediate path of travel.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: No risk due to inactivity and location.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

7. **Obstacle ID: 30196**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in the same lanelet 687.0; high velocity suggests a potential close encounter, but trajectory slightly offset.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Requires attention; significant speed but not on the collision course.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

8. **Obstacle ID: 30197**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary, located in lanelet 189.0, and not on the same path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: No immediate risk present due to lack of mobility.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

9. **Obstacle ID: 30198**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in lanelet 898.0, moving with no immediate threat based on direction.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Diverging trajectory minimizes collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

10. **Obstacle ID: 30200**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: In the same lanelet 687.0 as the ego vehicle, moving at high speed towards similar direction.
    - **Distance safety score**: 2
    - **Time Risk reason**: High similarity in speed and lane; risk of approach requires monitoring.
    - **Time safety score**: 2
    - **Overall Risk score**: 2

11. **Obstacle ID: 30201**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in lanelet 1641.0, moving away and not intersecting path.
    - **Distance safety score**: 5
    - **Time Risk reason**: Route moves away from the ego vehicle, negating the immediate threat.
    - **Time safety score**: 5
    - **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Summary in JSON Format: 
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

In this scenario, no obstacles are directly on a collision path with a risk score of 0 or classified under extreme risk with a score of 1. The highest risk identified here is associated with obstacle 30200, requiring close monitoring due to shared trajectory and similar velocity.
