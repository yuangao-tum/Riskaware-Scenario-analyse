Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.7 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

In this scenario, the ego vehicle is moving at a velocity of 7.652 m/s with a deceleration of -0.0159 m/s² and is in lanelet 687.0. We will calculate the Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) for each obstacle, particularly focusing on those within the same lanelet or on a potential collision trajectory.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30190.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The position of the obstacle and the ego vehicle suggest they are in adjacent lanes with a significant lateral distance.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** The velocities are not approaching in the same lane; thus, the TTC is not applicable.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30191.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is stationary, with a considerable distance from the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Since this obstacle is stationary, it does not pose an immediate risk for collision.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30192.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is moving, but the distance is significant enough that there is no immediate risk.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** As the obstacle's velocity varies, and assuming the ego vehicle does not collide, the TTC would suggest a safe time frame.
   - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 30193.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is moving but is at a considerable lateral distance from the ego vehicle’s trajectory.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Its velocity does not indicate a potential collision with the ego vehicle.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 30194.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle has significant lateral separation from the ego vehicle's path.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** The vehicle's speed does not pose a significant risk of collision.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID: 30195.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is stationary, providing a safe margin away from the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Given its stationary state, there is no collision risk.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

7. **Obstacle ID: 30196.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet and approaching.
   - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** The velocities suggest an imminent collision possibility; hence, urgent attention is needed.
   - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

8. **Obstacle ID: 30197.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is stationary and not in the trajectory; thus, it poses no risk.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Similar to the previous, being stationary means no risk of collision.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

9. **Obstacle ID: 30198.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Moving lateral to the ego vehicle; distance is adequate to avoid collision.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** The vehicle is approaching but not on a direct path to collision.
   - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

10. **Obstacle ID: 30200.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason:** The same lanelet may pose potential risks, but distance mitigates immediate concerns.
    - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
    - **Time Risk reason:** Relative speed suggests a risk but is manageable with timely reactions.
    - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

11. **Obstacle ID: 30201.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is further away from the ego vehicle's path.
    - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
    - **Time Risk reason:** No immediate collision risk is recognized due to distance and speed relative to the ego vehicle.
    - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
