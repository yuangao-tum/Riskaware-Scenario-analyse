Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.9 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.9: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

1. **Identify obstacles in the same lanelet or trajectory as the ego vehicle**:
   - The ego vehicle is currently located in lanelet 3034.0. We will analyze the obstacles located in this lanelet and any closely related lanelets.

2. **Calculate Metrics**:
   - **Time to Collision (TTC)** is calculated based on relative velocity and distance.
   - **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)** is calculated based on the distance between the ego vehicle and the obstacles.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30733.0
- Position: (-266.9449, -228.8995)
- Orientation: 0.7399
- Velocity: 0.1229
- Acceleration: -0.1625
- Current Lanelet: 3034.0

**Distance Risk Reason**: The relative position to the obstacle indicates it's quite close in the same lanelet.  
**Distance Safety Score**: 2 (High Risk)

**Time Risk Reason**: The relative velocity is very low (close to stationary), resulting in a low TTC that suggests potential collision.  
**Time Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

**Overall Risk Score**: 2 (High Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30734.0
- Position: (-269.4156, -226.4143)
- Orientation: 0.7387
- Velocity: 0.2895
- Acceleration: -0.2626
- Current Lanelet: 3033.0

**Distance Risk Reason**: Located in the adjacent lanelet and proximal to the ego vehicle, indicating it could become a potential collision risk if the ego does not maneuver correctly.  
**Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

**Time Risk Reason**: With a slight velocity, the TTC is manageable, thus indicating a lower immediate threat level.  
**Time Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

**Overall Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30736.0
- Position: (-283.2832, -229.5859)
- Orientation: 0.74
- Velocity: 4.4146
- Acceleration: 0.5646
- Current Lanelet: 3031.0

**Distance Risk Reason**: The distance is moderate, with the obstacle moving relatively quickly.  
**Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

**Time Risk Reason**: Given the higher velocity, the TTC may present a higher risk of closure, but still manageable.  
**Time Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

**Overall Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30735.0
- Position: (-271.6084, -223.6771)
- Orientation: 0.7379
- Velocity: 0.0552
- Acceleration: -0.0773
- Current Lanelet: 3032.0

**Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned in the adjacent lanelet, it could pose a collision risk if the ego vehicle shifts lanes without sufficient clearance.  
**Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

**Time Risk Reason**: Because of the low velocity, the time to collision remains adequate, suggesting comfort in safety spacing.  
**Time Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

**Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Conclusion:
The analysis of obstacles surrounding the ego vehicle indicates that there are no immediate collisions but several medium risks that must be monitored. The main concern would be obstacle 30733, which presents a high risk of collision. Other obstacles in the vicinity suggest caution but are at manageable distances and speeds.
