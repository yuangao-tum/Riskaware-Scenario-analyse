Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.9 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.9: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since the provided scenario lacks crucial information like lane boundaries, obstacle dimensions, and precise trajectories, I'll make some assumptions for demonstration:

* **Circular Obstacle Approximation:**  Obstacles are treated as points for simplified distance calculations.  In a real system, obstacle shapes and sizes would be factored into the TTC and MDC.
* **Linear Trajectories:**  Short-term future trajectories are assumed to be linear based on current velocity and acceleration. This is a simplification; actual trajectories can be curved.
* **Lanelet Interpretation:**  While lanelet IDs are given, without lane geometry, I'll primarily rely on position and velocity differences for risk assessment.
* **TTC and MDC Calculation Details:** Due to the complexity of calculating precise TTC and MDC without trajectory information and object dimensions, I will provide qualitative assessments based on relative positions and velocities.  A robust system would require more detailed trajectory predictions and collision checks.


### Obstacle Analysis:

**General Observations:** Several obstacles are near the ego vehicle and moving.  Those with similar orientations to the ego vehicle (around 0.74) are likely in the same or adjacent lanes and represent the highest potential risks. Obstacles with orientations around 2.35 are likely on crossing or merging trajectories.


- **Obstacle ID: 30717**
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively close and moving faster than ego.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Could approach ego quickly based on its velocity, needs more precise trajectory information.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30718**
- Distance Risk reason:  Close proximity, stationary.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Lower risk as it's stationary, but ego is moving.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30719**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close, stationary.
- Distance safety score: 3

... (Similar analysis would be repeated for each obstacle.  Obstacles 30733, 30734, 30735, 30739, and 30740 are in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and thus require more careful analysis.  Their risk scores will depend on their relative velocities and distances.) ...

- **Obstacle ID: 30750**
- Distance Risk reason:  Far away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  No immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**Important Note:** This analysis is a demonstration with simplified assumptions.  A real autonomous driving system requires highly accurate sensor data, detailed environment models, robust trajectory prediction, and comprehensive collision checking algorithms.  The risk assessment presented here should not be used for actual vehicle control.
