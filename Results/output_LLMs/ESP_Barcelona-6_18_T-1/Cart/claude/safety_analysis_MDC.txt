Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.9 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario and evaluate collision risks for the ego vehicle.

First, let's identify the key information:
- Ego vehicle is in lanelet 3034 at the end of the scenario
- The ego vehicle's position is around (-278.4953, -239.4295)
- The ego vehicle is moving with velocity 1.0434 m/s

Analyzing obstacles in proximity and potential collision paths:

1. Most concerning obstacles:
- Obstacle 30733: In the same lanelet 3034, very close proximity
- Obstacle 30734: In adjacent lanelet 3033, close proximity
- Obstacle 30735: In adjacent lanelet 3032, moderate proximity

Detailed Safety Analysis:

For Obstacle 30733:
- Distance Risk reason: Very close proximity in same lanelet, ~1-2m distance
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Low relative velocity but very close distance
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

For Obstacle 30734:
- Distance Risk reason: Close proximity in adjacent lanelet
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Low relative velocity, moderate separation
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

For Obstacle 30735:
- Distance Risk reason: Moderate separation in adjacent lanelet
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Very low relative velocity
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30733",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
```

Key findings:
1. Obstacle 30733 poses the highest risk due to its very close proximity in the same lanelet
2. The ego vehicle's low speed helps reduce collision risks
3. Lateral separation from obstacles in adjacent lanelets provides some safety margin
4. No immediate collisions detected but extreme caution needed with Obstacle 30733
