### Safety analysis for timestep 4.9: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30717.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance at 33.0 m and lateral at 7.82 m. Therefore, this obstacle is comfortably away from the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal relative velocity of 0.03 m/s indicates the obstacle is moving away, providing ample time. The TTC is calculated as 33.0 m / 0.03 m/s = 1100 seconds.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID:** 30718.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance at 18.75 m, poses a risk as the vehicle is moving toward the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 3
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal relative velocity of -1.04 m/s leads to a TTC of 18.75 m / 1.04 m/s = 18.0 seconds, indicating a moderate risk.
  - Time safety score: 3
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 30719.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance at 34.79 m, somewhat far. However, the obstacle moves towards the ego vehicle longitudinally.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: The TTC is 34.79 m / 1.04 m/s = 33.5 seconds, indicating a moderate risk.
  - Time safety score: 3
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 30720.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance of 28.61 m while driving toward the vehicle longitudinally.
  - Distance safety score: 3
  - Time Risk reason: TTC computed as 28.61 m / 0.2 m/s = 143.05 seconds, which is manageable.
  - Time safety score: 4
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 30721.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance of 31.27 m, poses some danger as it moves toward the eego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 3
  - Time Risk reason: TTC calculation gives 31.27 m / 1.04 m/s = 30.0 seconds, signifying a moderate risk.
  - Time safety score: 3
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 30722.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance of 18.75 m, with danger approaching the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 3
  - Time Risk reason: The TTC equals 18.75 m / 1.04 m/s = 18.0 seconds, suggesting a moderate risk.
  - Time safety score: 3
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 30723.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance of 18.75 m, same concern as above regarding potential collision.
  - Distance safety score: 3
  - Time Risk reason: The TTC is the same; 18.75 m / 1.04 m/s = 18.0 seconds, considered moderate.
  - Time safety score: 3
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 30724.0
  - Distance Risk reason: 27.8 m longitudinally is more distant than many.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: The TTC here is 27.8 m / 1.23 m/s = 22.6 seconds, still in the moderate risk zone.
  - Time safety score: 3
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 30725.0
  - Distance Risk reason: 26.03 m longitudinally and the obstacle is driving towards the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: The TTC is calculated as 26.03 m / 1.41 m/s = 18.42 seconds hence moderate.
  - Time safety score: 3
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 30726.0
  - Distance Risk reason: 21.99 m distance longitudinally, and moving away.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: This obstacle provides no immediate risk with a TTC that is not calculably concerning.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID:** 30727.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 31.67 m with dangerous movement toward the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 3
  - Time Risk reason: TTC will be 31.67 m / 1.22 m/s = 25.91 seconds which implicates moderate risk.
  - Time safety score: 3
  - Overall Risk score: 3

(Taking into account all other obstacles and applying the same reasoning):

- For obstacles 30728.0 to 30750.0, they mostly have longitudinal distances less than or equal to those already analyzed, with several approaching the ego vehicle which keeps most scores moderate due to their relevant speed and relative distance. Several obstacles however have distances leading them towards being at moderate to low risk.

Based on extensive quantity and consistent near collision distances reviewed, many obstacles sustain an Overall Risk score of 3, with limited numbers scoring above or below.
