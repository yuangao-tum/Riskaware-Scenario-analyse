### Safety analysis for timestep 4.9: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30717.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is 33.0 m longitudinally and 7.82 m laterally from the ego vehicle, which provides a safe buffer. 
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocity maintains a steady distance, and it is moving laterally away with very low longitudinal speed.
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30718.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is 18.75 m longitudinally and right in front of the ego vehicle, which indicates it could become a potential conflict point.
  - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocity of -1.04 m/s indicates it is approaching quickly, resulting in a potential imminent collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2

- **Obstacle ID:** 30719.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is 34.79 m longitudinally and laterally positioned to the front-right, creating some distance.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** With a relative longitudinal speed indicating approach (-1.04 m/s), albeit without lateral movement, the time risk remains manageable.
  - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 30720.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is 28.61 m longitudinally, moving toward the ego car, indicating a potential risk soon.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocity (-0.2 m/s longitudinally) is a concern as this object is decently close.
  - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2

- **Obstacle ID:** 30721.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** It is 31.27 m away and is approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** With a relative velocity approaching of -1.04 m/s, it generates concern about potential collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2

- **Obstacle ID:** 30722.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** It is 18.75 m longitudinally and situated directly in front, posing a definite risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Similar to 30718.0, it approaches at -1.04 m/s.
  - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2

- **Obstacle ID:** 30723.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is in a similar position (18.75 m) to the earlier ones, right in front.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** With the same relative velocity situation as above, it is an immediate concern.
  - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2

- **Obstacle ID:** 30724.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** 27.8 m away longitudinally with lateral movement right, which presents a situation to monitor despite some distance.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The object approaches the ego vehicle, similar to previous instances.
  - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2

- **Obstacle ID:** 30725.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Presenting a buffer longitudinally at 26.03 m, but longitudinal velocity indicates it is closing in quickly.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** As its relative longitudinal speed is -1.41 m/s, it is a recurring theme generating concern.
  - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 30726.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** 21.99 m away longitudinally with significant lateral space.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** This vehicle is moving away and presents less immediate risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30727.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** 31.67 m longitudinally. Thus, an adequate distance with increased lateral concern.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Approaching with longitudinal motion raises concerns, so classified as moderate.
  - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2
