### Safety analysis for timestep 9.2 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 3094.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance (11.35 m) indicates a significant gap, but the lateral distance (33.97 m) is large. Obstacle is moving toward ego longitudinally, which keeps it relevant for risk.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4
   - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal relative velocity (-1.09 m/s) implies it is approaching the ego car with a TTC of:
     \[
     TTC_{long} = \frac{DTClong}{|Vrel_{long}|} = \frac{11.35}{1.09} \approx 10.41 \text{ seconds}
     \]
     The lateral velocity does not significantly contribute to risk. Thus, the overall time is manageable.
   - **Time safety score:** 4
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4

2. **Obstacle ID: 3096.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal (-10.4 m) indicates this obstacle is quite close, but it is moving away laterally; this mitigates risk.
   - **Distance safety score:** 3
   - **Time Risk reason:** It is moving away longitudinally with a relative velocity of (-6.44 m/s). The TTC would be:
     \[
     TTC_{long} = \frac{-10.4}{-6.44} \approx 1.62 \text{ seconds}
     \]
     There is a potential risk given its closeness.
   - **Time safety score:** 2
   - **Overall Risk score:** 2

3. **Obstacle ID: 3097.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal (-26.17 m) indicates distance is good, while lateral (-7.79 m) is also safe. Moving away reduces risk.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4
   - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal velocity (-1.21 m/s) indicates:
     \[
     TTC_{long} = \frac{-26.17}{-1.21} \approx 21.63 \text{ seconds}
     \]
     which implies ample time; hence the time risk is low.
   - **Time safety score:** 5
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4

4. **Obstacle ID: 3099.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal (8.67 m) and lateral (-13.33 m) suggest a close yet controllable situation. However, obstacles are approaching longitudinally.
   - **Distance safety score:** 3
   - **Time Risk reason:** TTC is:
     \[
     TTC_{long} = \frac{8.67}{0.76} \approx 11.43 \text{ seconds}
     \]
     This gives enough time to react properly.
   - **Time safety score:** 4
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4

5. **Obstacle ID: 3100.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** It is very close (8.56 m longitudinal and aligned exactly laterally) and moving toward the ego car.
   - **Distance safety score:** 2
   - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal relative velocity (-4.1 m/s) gives:
     \[
     TTC_{long} = \frac{8.56}{4.1} \approx 2.09 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - **Time safety score:** 2
   - **Overall Risk score:** 2

6. **Obstacle ID: 3101.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal (-22.76 m) and lateral (-7.95 m) suggest good distance; it is moving away.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4
   - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle generally moves away and has a TTC of:
     \[
     TTC_{long} = \frac{-22.76}{-0.88} \approx 25.84 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - **Time safety score:** 5
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4

7. **Obstacle ID: 3102.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal (-22.03 m) indicates sufficient space, while the lateral (0.02 m) indicates close approach from left, increasing risk.
   - **Distance safety score:** 2
   - **Time Risk reason:** Represents a risk given the TTC:
     \[
     TTC_{long} = \frac{-22.03}{-6.26} \approx 3.51 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - **Time safety score:** 3
   - **Overall Risk score:** 2

8. **Obstacle ID: 3103.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The gap (12.17 m longitudinal and -7.69 m laterally) is manageable, but it approaches longitudinally.
   - **Distance safety score:** 3
   - **Time Risk reason:** With its speed,
     \[
     TTC_{long} = \frac{12.17}{0.88} \approx 13.83 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - **Time safety score:** 4
   - **Overall Risk score:** 3

9. **Obstacle ID: 3104.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal (12.2 m) and lateral (-16.1 m) are acceptable distances, yet it is approaching both lateral and longitudinally, which is a concern.
   - **Distance safety score:** 3
   - **Time Risk reason:** It approaches with a TTC of:
     \[
     TTC_{long} = \frac{12.2}{0.88} \approx 13.86 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - **Time safety score:** 4
   - **Overall Risk score:** 3

10. **Obstacle ID: 3105.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason:** It has sufficient distance longitudinally (12.21 m) but is moving toward the ego car laterally.
    - **Distance safety score:** 3
    - **Time Risk reason:** It creates potential risk with a TTC of:
      \[
      TTC_{long} = \frac{12.21}{0.87} \approx 14.06 \text{ seconds}
      \]
    - **Time safety score:** 4
    - **Overall Risk score:** 3

11. **Obstacle ID: 3106.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason:** Safe distances longitudinally (-22.82 m) and laterally (-15.47 m). This obstacle is leaving the scene.
    - **Distance safety score:** 4
    - **Time Risk reason:** Excellent TTC values:
      \[
      TTC_{long} = \frac{-22.82}{-0.88} \approx 25.91 \text{ seconds}
      \]
    - **Time safety score:** 5
    - **Overall Risk score:** 4

12. **Obstacle ID: 3107.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is critically close longitudinally (-0.14 m) with no significant lateral movement; thus, action should be needed soon.
    - **Distance safety score:** 1
    - **Time Risk reason:** Moving directly towards from behind at a relatively good speed:
      \[
      TTC_{long} = \frac{-0.14}{1.92} \approx 0.07 \text{ seconds}
      \]
    - **Time safety score:** 1
    - **Overall Risk score:** 1

13. **Obstacle ID: 3108.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason:** Far spacing in both longitudinal (-22.88 m) and lateral (-23.13 m) dimensions. Hence minimal risk.
    - **Distance safety score:** 4
    - **Time Risk reason:** With no immediate threat, a high TTC reflects well:
      \[
      TTC_{long} = \frac{-22.88}{-0.88} \approx 25.96 \text{ seconds}
      \]
    - **Time safety score:** 5
    - **Overall Risk score:** 4
