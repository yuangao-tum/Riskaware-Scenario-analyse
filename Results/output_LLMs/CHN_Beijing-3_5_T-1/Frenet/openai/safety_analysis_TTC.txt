  - **Distance safety score**: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away, providing a TTC of approximately 18 seconds.
  - **Time safety score**: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: **5** (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 3099.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: 8.67 m longitudinally indicates a potential risk, but the distance is still manageable.
  - **Distance safety score**: **4** (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The -0.76 m/s relative velocity longitudinally with a TTC of 11.4 seconds indicates low immediate risk.
  - **Time safety score**: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: **4** (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 3100.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is 8.56 m which is quite close, but the lateral position is aligned directly ahead, increasing odds of conflict.
  - **Distance safety score**: **3** (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The longitudinal speed is -4.1 m/s indicating potential collision in around 2.1 seconds.
  - **Time safety score**: **2** (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: **2** (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 3101.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: 22.76 m longitudinally is safe, but it is still in the vicinity of the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: **4** (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Moving away, suggesting a safe increase in distance; a TTC of 25.8 seconds.
  - **Time safety score**: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: **4** (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 3102.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: 22.03 m longitudinally places it safely behind the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The lateral approach increases risk, with a TTC of approximately 3.65 seconds suggesting a potential danger.
  - **Time safety score**: **3** (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: **4** (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 3103.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned 12.17 m in front and laterally aligned, indicating a higher collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: **3** (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC in longitudinal movement is around 13.8 seconds giving time to maneuver, but still requires some caution.
  - **Time safety score**: **4** (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: **3** (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 3104.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: 12.2 m in front indicates a managing danger with an approach likely.
  - **Distance safety score**: **3** (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal approach with a TTC of about 13.85 seconds with ongoing lateral motion poses a management challenge.
  - **Time safety score**: **3** (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: **3** (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 3105.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Similar to previous obstacles, with 12.21 m in the front. Close enough to cause concern.
  - **Distance safety score**: **3** (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The approach speed gives a TTC of about 14 seconds, manageable but requires awareness.
  - **Time safety score**: **4** (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: **3** (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 3106.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: 22.82 m longitudinally is substantial and allows for concern but minimal proximity due to lateral distance.
  - **Distance safety score**: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC of 25.9 seconds indicates a safely disengaging situation.
  - **Time safety score**: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: **5** (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 3107.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: At -0.14 m longitudinally, the obstacle is immediately behind and requires caution or avoidance.
  - **Distance safety score**: **1** (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Rapid approach at 1.92 m/s creating nearly a direct clash, thus an urgent response needed.
  - **Time safety score**: **1** (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: **1** (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 3108.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinally -22.88 m is a safe distance, as it is moving to the right laterally.
  - **Distance safety score**: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The safe distancing indicates a long TTC, meaning minor concern with ample time to adjust.
  - **Time safety score**: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: **5** (Negligible Risk)
