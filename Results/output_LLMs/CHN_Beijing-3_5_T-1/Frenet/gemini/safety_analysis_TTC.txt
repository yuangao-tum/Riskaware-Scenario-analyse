### Safety analysis for timestep 9.2s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 3094.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Laterally far away (33.97m), longitudinally moderately close (11.35m) and moving closer.  Front-left location presents some risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal velocity indicates closing, but positive lateral velocity indicates moving away.  TTClong calculation needed for further assessment.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 3096.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Laterally very close (1.82m) and longitudinally slightly behind (-10.4m), but moving closer laterally. Rear-left location poses a risk if lateral movement continues.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, but slightly towards the ego car laterally. Requires careful monitoring due to lateral proximity.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 3097.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Longitudinally and laterally far behind and moving away (-26.17m, -7.79m). Poses no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away in both directions.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


**- Obstacle ID: 3099.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close longitudinally (8.67m) and laterally to the right (-13.33m) but moving away laterally.  Front-right location presents some risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal velocity suggests closing, but lateral movement is away. Further analysis using TTClong is required.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 3100.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Longitudinally very close (8.56m) and directly in front.  High risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally (-4.1 m/s). Requires immediate action. TTClong calculation is crucial.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 3101.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Far behind and to the right, moving away (-22.76m, -7.95m). No immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 3102.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Far behind longitudinally (-22.03m) but near the center laterally (0.02m), and moving closer laterally.  Rear-left location requires monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Moving away longitudinally but closer laterally.  Lateral velocity is relatively low, but proximity necessitates attention.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 3103.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately far longitudinally (12.17m) and to the right (-7.69m). Front-right location and closing longitudinal velocity pose a moderate risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving closer longitudinally but no lateral movement.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 3104.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately far longitudinally (12.2m) and to the right (-16.1m).  Front-right location and longitudinal closing require attention.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal velocity indicates approach.  Lateral movement towards ego also slightly increases risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


**- Obstacle ID: 3105.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately far longitudinally (12.21m) and further to the right (-24.93m). Front-right location with closing longitudinal movement requires monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally and slightly laterally.  Requires monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 3106.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Far behind and to the right (-22.82m, -15.47m) and moving slightly closer laterally. Poses minimal risk currently.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, but very slightly towards the ego laterally.  Low risk given the distance.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 3107.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close longitudinally (-0.14m) and directly behind. Very high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Moving closer longitudinally and almost aligned laterally. Immediate action is necessary.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 3108.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Far behind and to the right (-22.88m, -23.13m) but slightly moving closer laterally. Minimal immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally and very slightly closer laterally. Very low risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
