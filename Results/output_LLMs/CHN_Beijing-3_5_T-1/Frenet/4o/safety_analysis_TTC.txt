### Safety analysis for timestep 9.2 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3094.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is relatively far (longitudinal 11.35 m, lateral 33.97 m) and moving away laterally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: With the longitudinal velocity of -1.09 m/s, the TTC is significant as the obstacle is moving away laterally.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3096.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is behind but moving away longitudinally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Moving away in longitudinal direction with -6.44 m/s velocity, lowering any collision likelihood.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3097.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned behind to the rear-right and moving away laterally and longitudinally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Negative longitudinal and lateral velocity, indicating movement away.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3099.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Close to the front-right but moving away laterally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Its negative longitudinal velocity (-0.76 m/s) and lateral velocity (-8.91 m/s) support clearance soon.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3100.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Directly in front at 8.56 m with negative velocity approaching.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2
  - **Time Risk reason**: Relatively high longitudinal velocity approaching the ego car (-4.1 m/s), implying lesser TTC.
  - **Time safety score**: 2
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 3101.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Rear-right obstacle, but moving away longitudinally without lateral motion.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Slow negative velocity indicating the movement away.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3102.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Rear-left at a decent distance, moving away longitudinally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: High negative velocity indicating significant rearward motion.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3103.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Front-right positioning with safe clearance distance.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Low relative velocity aiding in sustaining distance.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3104.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Safe clearance at front-right; small lateral movement towards.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Minimal relative motion longitudinally provides enough buffer.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3105.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Safe front-right clearance, minor lateral inward motion.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Movement is toward laterally but small; low longitudinal velocity.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3106.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Rear-right and moving away with ample clearance.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Negative longitudinal motion enhances safe distance maintenance.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3107.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Very close behind at -0.14 m, maintaining parallel direction.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1
  - **Time Risk reason**: Relative speed low; obstacle keeping position but close proximity suggests extreme caution.
  - **Time safety score**: 1
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 3108.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned rear-right safely, moving away longitudinally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Combination of slow negative velocity further lessens threat.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5
