Safety analysis for the last timestep (9.2 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 9.2: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3094.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is located in lanelet 67, which is different from ego's lanelet 55, reducing immediate collision risk.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Relative velocity is high, and trajectory doesn't suggest an immediate collision path.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 4.5

- **Obstacle ID: 3096.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is slightly ahead and to the side in lanelet 54, close to ego's lanelet, but trajectories suggest a safe buffer.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: TTC is manageable with current speeds and orientations.
  - Time safety score: 4
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3097.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: In a different lanelet (51), traveling at a safe distance.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Obstacle's path does not intersect with the ego vehicle's course in the immediate timeframe.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3099.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Located away from ego vehicle and in a different lanelet (63), mitigating collision prospects.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: No overlapping trajectory with ego's.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3100.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Different lanelet (360), not posing a direct threat presently.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Relative motion does not lead towards the ego vehicle's path currently.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3101.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Stationary object in lanelet 52, substantially distant laterally.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Not moving, allowing ample time to avoid any issues.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3102.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Lanelet 362 presents no direct collision course with the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Paths are non-intersecting under current motion.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3103.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Stationary in lanelet 64, sufficiently distant from direct collision risk.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Not a moving threat, long-term non-collision trajectory.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3104.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Positioned in lanelet 64 and moving away, low collision risk.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: TTC is significantly large due to diverging path.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3105.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Lanelet 64 placement creates ample safe buffer.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Movement vector diverges away from ego's path.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3106.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Lanelet 52 location, coupled with minimal movement, suggests no urgent collision concern.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Not significantly probable under current trajectories.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3107.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Moving in same lanelet (55) as ego vehicle but maintaining adequate lateral and longitudinal separation.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Moderate speed doesn't promote quick convergence, providing time for adjustments.
  - Time safety score: 4
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3108.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Stationary in lanelet 52, poses no imminent risk.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Relative position and velocity mitigate collision risk.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5
