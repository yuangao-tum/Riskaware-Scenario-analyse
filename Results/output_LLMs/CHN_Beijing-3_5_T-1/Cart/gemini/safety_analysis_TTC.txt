Safety analysis for the last timestep (9.2 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 9.2: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories and dimensions of vehicles aren't provided, I'm making simplified calculations based on Euclidean distances and straight-line projections.  A more robust analysis would involve considering vehicle shapes, predicted paths, and more sophisticated collision detection algorithms. I will primarily use distance as a proxy for risk, assuming a larger distance implies lower risk. I'm also assuming a TTC threshold of 3 seconds for high risk, 5 seconds for medium risk, and above 7 as lower risk. MDC is relative here and based on approximate distances provided.

**### Obstacle Analysis:**
