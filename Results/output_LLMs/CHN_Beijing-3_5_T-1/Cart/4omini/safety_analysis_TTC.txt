Safety analysis for the last timestep (9.2 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 9.2:

Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations:

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 3094.0
    - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is in lanelet 67.0, moving at a high speed (13.2751) toward the ego vehicle's position, potentially crossing into its lane.
    - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
    - **Time Risk reason:** The high speed of the obstacle suggests a very short time until collision based on the ego vehicle's limited velocity.
    - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 3096.0
    - **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is in lanelet 54.0, also moving but further away from the ego vehicle's trajectory.
    - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
    - **Time Risk reason:** This obstacle has a moderate velocity (5.5633), allowing for minimal time to react but not immediate.
    - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 3101.0
    - **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is stationary (0.0 velocity) but close enough to the ego vehicle's path.
    - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
    - **Time Risk reason:** With 0 velocity, this can present a high-risk collision path if the ego vehicle were to move quickly without adjustment.
    - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 3107.0
    - **Distance Risk reason:** Also in lanelet 55.0, moving at 2.8035, but relatively away from the ego vehicle.
    - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
    - **Time Risk reason:** The slow speed permits a higher time to react, reducing immediate collision potential.
    - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format: 
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [
        {
            "ObstacleID": "3094.0",
            "OverallRiskScore": "1"
        }
    ],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    }
}
```

### Detailed Explanation:
- Obstacle 3094.0 showed immediate collision risk based on its trajectory and speed. Thus, it receives the highest risk score (1) due to its extreme risk of collision.
- Obstacles 3096.0 and 3101.0 present a high risk, given their speeds and proximity.
- Obstacle 3107.0 is moving slowly enough to allow the ego vehicle time to react, hence a low risk rating.

Overall, immediate action is needed concerning obstacle 3094.0 to prevent a collision, while the others may require monitoring, but are not currently presenting critical danger.
