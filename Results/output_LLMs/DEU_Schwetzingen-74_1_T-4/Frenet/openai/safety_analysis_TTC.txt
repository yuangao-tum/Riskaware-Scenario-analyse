### Safety analysis for timestep 3.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID**: 20018.0
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Longitudinal 292.16 m, lateral -96.7 m: No immediate distance risk as the obstacle is too far and moving away longitudinally.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
   - **Time Risk Reason**: TTC long = 292.16 / 0.73 ≈ 400.22 s (no collision), lateral is also safe; significant time to react.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID**: 20020.0
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Longitudinal 285.33 m, lateral -99.43 m: Sufficient distance and moving away longitudinally.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
   - **Time Risk Reason**: TTC long = 285.33 / 2.2 ≈ 129.67 s, lateral safe as well.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

3. **Obstacle ID**: 20034.0
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Longitudinal 92.46 m, lateral -163.81 m: Close distance but moving away laterally.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
   - **Time Risk Reason**: TTC long = 92.46 / -1.85 < 0 (collision risk); but laterally does not present a risk due to outgoing movement.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 2
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 3

4. **Obstacle ID**: 20035.0
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Longitudinal 89.22 m, lateral -157.23 m: Similar as above, closer but moderately risk.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
   - **Time Risk Reason**: TTC long = 89.22 / -1.89 < 0; movement is manageable with proper strategy to avoid.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 2
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 3

5. **Obstacle ID**: 20037.0
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Longitudinal 82.91 m, lateral -144.21 m: Moderately close with a risk.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 3
   - **Time Risk Reason**: TTC long = 82.91 / -1.20 < 0, similar as above.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 2
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 2

6. **Obstacle ID**: 20038.0
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Longitudinal 76.41 m, lateral -130.79 m: Under moderate risk longitudinally, moving away.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
   - **Time Risk Reason**: TTC long = 76.41 / 0.14 ≈ 545.79 s; Time to avoid collision is significant.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

7. **Obstacle ID**: 20039.0
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Longitudinal 68.63 m, lateral -114.68 m: Close, but moving away.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Similar calculation as before; no direct collision.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

8. **Obstacle ID**: 20040.0
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Longitudinal 298.87 m, lateral -94.79 m: Safe distance.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
   - **Time Risk Reason**: TTC long = 298.87 / -2.04 < 0; no immediate risk here.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 2
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 3

9. **Obstacle ID**: 20041.0
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Longitudinal 102.13 m, lateral -165.3 m: Safe distance.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
   - **Time Risk Reason**: TTC long = 102.13 / -2.04 < 0; not an immediate threat.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 2
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 3

10. **Obstacle ID**: 20043.0
    - **Distance Risk Reason**: Longitudinal 60.21 m, lateral -88.13 m: Danger is recurring due to negative velocity.
    - **Distance Safety Score**: 2
    - **Time Risk Reason**: TTC long = 60.21 / -6.56 < 0; immediate action is needed.
    - **Time Safety Score**: 1
    - **Overall Risk Score**: 1

11. **Obstacle ID**: 20055.0
    - **Distance Risk Reason**: Longitudinal 90.4 m, lateral -151.65 m: Close, ON COLLISION PATH.
    - **Distance Safety Score**: 1
    - **Time Risk Reason**: TTC long = 90.4 / 6.18 < 0; rapid action required.
    - **Time Safety Score**: 1
    - **Overall Risk Score**: 1

12. **Obstacle ID**: 20064.0
