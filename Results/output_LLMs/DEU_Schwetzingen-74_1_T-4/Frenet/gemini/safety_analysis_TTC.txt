### Safety analysis for timestep 3.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Methodology:**

Since precise TTC and MDC calculations require complex trajectory predictions, we'll use a simplified approach based on current relative velocity and distance.  A negative relative longitudinal velocity means the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle.  A positive value means it's moving away.

For lateral movement, the sign of the lateral distance and velocity needs to be considered together. For example, a negative lateral distance and a positive lateral velocity (for an obstacle in the front-right) implies the obstacle is moving further away.

**TTC Estimation:**  TTC is approximated as DTClong / Vrel_long if the relative velocity indicates the obstacle is approaching. Otherwise, TTC is considered infinite (no collision risk in the current trajectory). Similar logic applies to TTClat using DTClat and Vrel_lat.

**MDC Estimation**: We don't have enough information for a precise MDC calculation. We'll qualitatively assess risk based on current distances and relative motion.
