Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.4 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### 1. Identifying obstacles in the same lanelet or trajectory:
The ego vehicle is located in lanelet 5647.0. The obstacles that are also in lanelet 5647.0 are listed below for further analysis:

- Obstacle 20035.0
- Obstacle 20037.0
- Obstacle 20038.0
- Obstacle 20039.0
- Obstacle 20042.0
- Obstacle 20044.0
- Obstacle 20046.0
- Obstacle 20047.0
- Obstacle 20055.0
- Obstacle 20064.0

#### 2. Calculating both metrics:

- **TTC** focuses on the time until a possible impact in both longitudinal (fore and aft) and lateral (side-to-side) directions.
- **MDC** is derived from the direct spatial distances from the ego vehicle to the obstacles.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID**: 20035.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle (10.9054, -5.3689) is close ahead of the ego vehicle, leading to a minimal distance of 5.3 meters.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 
  - **Time Risk reason**: The ego vehicle is traveling forward (2.0425 m/s), while the obstacle is moving slowly (0.3468 m/s). Estimated TTC is reasonable (>6 seconds). 
  - **Time safety score**: 4 
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 

- **Obstacle ID**: 20037.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle (22.7386, -13.7013) is also ahead but relatively further away (11.5 meters).
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 
  - **Time Risk reason**: Similar reasoning to above, TTC is greater than 6 seconds.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 

- **Obstacle ID**: 20038.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle (34.9288, -22.2851) is 22.5 meters from the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 
  - **Time Risk reason**: With its low speed compared to the ego vehicle, the estimated TTC is significantly higher.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 

- **Obstacle ID**: 20039.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle (49.5401, -32.6077) is 36.0 meters distant, creating a negligible risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 
  - **Time Risk reason**: Its relative speed assures a high TTC (>8 seconds).
  - **Time safety score**: 5 
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 

- **Obstacle ID**: 20042.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle (64.1962, -43.2665) at a distance of 45.0 meters indicates low risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's speed (5.6577 m/s) compared to that of the ego vehicle gives a reasonable TTC based on separation.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 

- **Obstacle ID**: 20044.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: It is 50.0 meters away, involving minimal collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 
  - **Time Risk reason**: This obstacle is also moving slow enough to ensure a solid TTC. 
  - **Time safety score**: 5 
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 

- **Obstacle ID**: 20046.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: 52.0 meters away along the forward trajectory, indicating low risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 
  - **Time Risk reason**: The stranger speeds indicate a very high TTC. 
  - **Time safety score**: 5 
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 

- **Obstacle ID**: 20047.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle (101.3967, -70.6194) is far enough (75++) minimizing the risk score.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 
  - **Time Risk reason**: The low speed of the obstacle indicates high TTC.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 

- **Obstacle ID**: 20055.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance is significant (75+) allowing a safe lane for the ego.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 
  - **Time Risk reason**: negligible due to egregiously high separation.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 

- **Obstacle ID**: 20064.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: 65.0 meters away ensures no close threat.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 
  - **Time Risk reason**: No collisions anticipated due to high TTC due to speed differentials.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
``` 

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis above, there are no obstacles presenting a collision risk scoring 0 nor any at extreme risk scoring 1, indicating a safe environment relative to all detected obstacles at this timestep. All obstacles evaluated present low to negligible risk, with most scoring 5. This demonstrates an absence of imminent impacts or scenarios requiring urgent navigational changes.
