Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.4 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.4: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

Let's analyze the risk levels associated with each obstacle relative to the ego vehicle positioned at (169.8802, -98.8773) with a velocity of 2.0425 and an orientation of -2.635579105609347.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 20018.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is located in lanelet 2651.0, far from the ego vehicle's lanelet (5647.0). The distance is significant due to the disparate coordinates, indicating minimal collision risk.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5
   - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is moving away with a slightly higher speed but in a different trajectory. The TTC would be quite large.
   - **Time safety score:** 5
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 20020.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned in lanelet 2651.0, distant from ego's path. No immediate collision threat.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5
   - **Time Risk reason:** Despite a modest velocity, the obstacle's trajectory diverges from that of the ego vehicle.
   - **Time safety score:** 5
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5

3. **Obstacle ID: 20034.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** In lanelet 13891.0, at a significant distance, and poses no immediate threat.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5
   - **Time Risk reason:** Low speed and different lanelet suggest no immediate collision threat.
   - **Time safety score:** 5
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5

4. **Obstacle ID: 20035.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Same lanelet as the ego vehicle (5647.0) and relatively close. However, its low speed minimizes immediate collision risk.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4
   - **Time Risk reason:** Given the low speed, there's time to react. The TTC is substantial given the differences in velocity.
   - **Time safety score:** 4
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4

5. **Obstacle ID: 20037.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** In same lanelet but located far behind relative to ego's start, currently moving with low speed.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5
   - **Time Risk reason:** Velocity discrepancies lead to a large TTC. No immediate threat detected.
   - **Time safety score:** 5
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5

6. **Obstacle ID: 20038.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Same lanelet as the ego vehicle. However, still at a considerable distance.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4
   - **Time Risk reason:** Velocity is higher than ego, warrants attention, but still manageable.
   - **Time safety score:** 4
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4

7. **Obstacle ID: 20039.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned in lanelet 5647.0 with significant distance from the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4
   - **Time Risk reason:** High velocity observed; however, there's time to maneuver safely.
   - **Time safety score:** 4
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4

8. **Obstacle ID: 20040.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Stationary and distant in lanelet 2651.0, different from ego's.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5
   - **Time Risk reason:** Static nature, no collision risk.
   - **Time safety score:** 5
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5

9. **Obstacle ID: 20041.0 - 20052.0** (These cover multiple obstacles, sharing similar reasons)
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Distant lanelets, no significant overlap or immediate threat.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5
   - **Time Risk reason:** Varied velocities but present no immediate threat nearer to ego's trajectory.
   - **Time safety score:** 5
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5

10. **Obstacle ID: 20053.0 - 20064.0** (Another group of obstacles grouped collectively)
    - **Distance Risk reason:** Wide separation from the ego vehicle on different trajectories.
    - **Distance safety score:** 5
    - **Time Risk reason:** Diverse velocities and accelerations but no overlap in trajectory path imminent.
    - **Time safety score:** 5
    - **Overall Risk score:** 5
