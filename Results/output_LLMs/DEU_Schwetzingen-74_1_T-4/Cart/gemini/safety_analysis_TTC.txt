Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.4 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories, shapes, and sizes of the vehicles are not provided, we'll make simplified assumptions for this analysis. We'll treat vehicles as points and focus on the provided position, velocity, and acceleration data. TTC and MDC will be approximated based on these parameters.  We will consider a safety buffer distance (e.g., 2 meters) and a safe time to collision (e.g., 3 seconds) as thresholds in our evaluations. A more rigorous analysis would require more detailed information. "Relative direction" refers to whether the obstacle is moving towards (closing) or away (diverging) from the ego vehicle.

**Obstacles in the same lanelet (5647) as the ego vehicle pose the most immediate concern.** Obstacles in other lanelets will also be evaluated, but the focus will be on same-lanelet interactions.

**(Obstacles in Different Lanelets):** All other obstacles (20018, 20020, 20034, 20040, 20041, 20043, 20044, 20045, 20048, 20051, 20052, 20054, 20055, 20057, 20059, 20061, 20063) are in different lanelets and pose negligible or no immediate risk based on their current positions and velocities relative to the ego vehicle.  They are assigned an overall risk score of 5, but their trajectories should be monitored.
