Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.1 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 20028.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Close proximity in the lanelet, minimal distance.
   - Distance safety score: 2 (Close to collision)
   - Time Risk reason: Slow moving or stationary, which could lead to collision if no action is taken.
   - Time safety score: 2 (High likelihood of a collision if not addressed)
   - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 20036.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Close approach from the side in the same lanelet.
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Moderate risk due to lane keeping)
   - Time Risk reason: Given the slow relative velocity, potential collision risk is moderate but manageable.
   - Time safety score: 3 (Moderate risk but requires attention)
   - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 20047.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Moving forward in the same path way, close distance.
   - Distance safety score: 2 (Close to collision)
   - Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving toward the same path of the ego vehicle.
   - Time safety score: 2 (High likelihood of collision if not managed)
   - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 20048.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Significant distance but moving speed is high.
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Moderate distance but velocity leads to concern)
   - Time Risk reason: The vehicle is moving fast, increasing the risk of collision.
   - Time safety score: 2 (High risk due to speed)
   - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 20040.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Comparable velocities, but lateral separation exists.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Minimal risk)
   - Time Risk reason: They are not on a potential collision course.
   - Time safety score: 4 (Negligible time risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID: 20044.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Lateral distance is considerable, yet fast-moving.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Minimal distance risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The trajectory does not intersect.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

7. **Obstacle ID: 20051.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Distance is safe, no immediate threat.
   - Distance safety score: 5 (No risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Vehicle is not in a path that can cause a collision.
   - Time safety score: 5 (No risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
``` 

### Conclusion:
- All the evaluated obstacles have been assessed for both distance and time risks.
- There are no obstacles with an Overall Risk Score of 0 (indicating a definite collision) or 1 (indicating extreme risk).
- The analysis indicates high risks from several obstacles, but none are imminent collision threats at this moment.
