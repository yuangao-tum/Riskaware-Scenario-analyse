Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.1 seconds):
I'll analyze the collision risks for the ego vehicle (ID: 20050.0) based on the provided scenario.

Key observations:
1. The ego vehicle is located in lanelet 3428.0 and is moving with decreasing velocity (from 10.4856 to 4.6906).
2. Several obstacles share the same lanelet (3428.0) or adjacent lanelets.

Critical obstacles analysis:

1. Obstacle 20048.0:
- Distance Risk: Moderate. Located in lanelet 3428.0 (same as ego), relative distance decreasing.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk: High, converging trajectories with closing distance.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

2. Obstacle 20052.0:
- Distance Risk: High. Moving in lanelet 3428.0, close proximity.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk: Extreme, high relative velocity and converging paths.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

3. Obstacle 20047.0:
- Distance Risk: Moderate. In lanelet 3428.0 but maintaining distance.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk: Moderate, stable relative positioning.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

Most other obstacles are either:
- In different lanelets with safe distances
- Moving away from the ego vehicle
- Stationary with sufficient separation

Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20052.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
```

Key findings:
1. Obstacle 20052.0 presents the highest risk due to its close proximity and converging trajectory in the same lanelet.
2. No immediate collisions detected (score 0) but one extreme risk situation (score 1).
3. Multiple moderate risk situations require monitoring but don't present immediate danger.

Recommendation: The ego vehicle should maintain heightened awareness of Obstacle 20052.0 and consider defensive driving maneuvers to increase separation distance.
