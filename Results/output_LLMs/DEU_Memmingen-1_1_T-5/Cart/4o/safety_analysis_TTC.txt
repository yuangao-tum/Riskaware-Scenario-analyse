### Summary in JSON Format:

```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Overall, the obstacles present within or around the ego vehicle largely comprise stationary objects or those moving in non-intersecting paths. The analysis reveals a general awareness and potential management of moderate arising risks through controlled maneuvers and adjustments by the ego vehicle. No immediate extreme or collision risks were identified under current conditions.
