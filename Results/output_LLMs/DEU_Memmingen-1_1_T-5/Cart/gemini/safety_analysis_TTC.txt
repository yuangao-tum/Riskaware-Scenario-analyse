Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.1 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

*  Since precise trajectories are not provided, we will primarily rely on current positions, velocities, and orientations to estimate risk. This analysis assumes straight-line motion for simplification, which might not reflect real-world scenarios perfectly.  A more thorough analysis would require trajectory predictions.
* "DTClong" and "DTClat" refer to longitudinal and lateral distances to collision, respectively.  These will be used to estimate MDC.
* "TTClong" and "TTClat" refer to longitudinal and lateral times to collision, respectively.
* The coordinate system's orientation is not explicitly defined, so assumptions about North, East, and the lanelet orientations relative to the coordinates are difficult to make. This limits precise directional risk assessment.
* A general heuristic for "Overall Risk Score" will be employed based on the TTC and MDC, prioritizing TTC due to its importance in dynamic situations.  A more robust scoring system would require more context about the scenario and vehicle dynamics.


### Obstacle Analysis:

**General Approach:**

1. **Lanelet Filtering:** Focus on obstacles in the ego vehicle's lanelet (3428) and adjacent lanelets (3429) if their trajectories might intersect.
2. **Distance Calculation:**  Approximate Euclidean distance between ego and obstacle positions as a proxy for MDC.
3. **TTC Estimation:** Roughly estimate TTC using relative velocities and distances, acknowledging limitations due to unknown future trajectories.
4. **Risk Assessment:** Assign risk scores based on the heuristic described above.
