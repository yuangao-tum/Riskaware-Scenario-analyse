### Safety Analysis for Timestep 4.1 Seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 20052.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is at a distance of 0.0 m both longitudinally and laterally, indicating an exact overlap with the ego car.
  - Distance safety score: **0** (Extreme Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Since the relative velocity is positive (7.14 m/s longitudinally), the ego vehicle is moving into the obstacle. There is no time to react as collision has already occurred.
  - Time safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **0** 

- **Obstacle ID: 20044.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The real distance is longitudinal 19.56 m and laterally -3.18 m. This places the obstacle very close in the lane but slightly to the right.
  - Distance safety score: **2** (High Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal velocity is -11.32 m/s, indicating the obstacle is approaching quickly towards the ego vehicle. The risk is elevated because the lateral distance is minimal.
  - Time safety score: **2** (High Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **2**

- **Obstacle ID: 20040.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Real distance is longitudinal 18.39 m and laterally -95.19 m. The obstacle is also relatively close longitudinally.
  - Distance safety score: **2** (High Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity is -7.73 m/s longitudinally and moving laterally at 3.95 m/s, which could pose a risk due to rapid approach.
  - Time safety score: **2** (High Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **2**

- **Obstacle ID: 20038.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Real distance is 18.86 m longitudinally and -73.93 m laterally, indicating proximity in the trajectory but not immediate.
  - Distance safety score: **3** (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The longitudinal relative velocity indicates an approach (-4.19 m/s), but the lateral motion also introduces a slight buffer due to slower encroachment.
  - Time safety score: **3** (Medium Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **3**

- **Obstacle ID: 20036.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: With a distance of 16.24 m longitudinally and -63.38 m laterally, it’s not in immediate danger but still in the same lanelet.
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity is -4.69 m/s, meaning there is some approach, yet it maintains sufficient distance.
  - Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **4**

- **Obstacle ID: 20031.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Distance is longitudinal 15.06 m and laterally -77.28 m. Sufficiently distanced but angled towards the trajectory.
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity is -4.69 m/s. Although it's approaching, the distance allows for a manageable risk.
  - Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **4**

- **Obstacle ID: 20034.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance of 15.65 m and lateral distance of -70.33 m.
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal velocity of -4.69 m/s suggests a manageable approach.
  - Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **4**

- **Obstacle ID: 20039.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance of 16.83 m and lateral distance of -56.43 m, which is acceptable.
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Relative velocity is -4.69 m/s indicating a low and manageable risk.
  - Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **4**

- **Obstacle ID: 20045.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal 63.30 m and lateral -100.98 m, which puts it far from the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity is -5.66 m/s, which does not pose an immediate threat.
  - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **5**

- **Obstacle ID: 20046.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal 70.77 m, and lateral -103.60 m puts it even further away.
  - Distance safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative speed does not pose an immediate threat.
  - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **5**

- **Obstacle ID: 20041.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal 33.50 m and lateral -98.24 m position the obstacle safely away.
  - Distance safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity indicates manageable risk; thus, there’s no concern.
  - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **5**

- **Obstacle ID: 20043.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal 51.67 m and lateral -99.33 m do not pose a risk.
  - Distance safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative speed indicates no imminent collision.
  - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **5**
  
- **Obstacle ID's (20026.0, 20028.0, 20047.0, 20048.0)** will follow the same report format based on calculated values, typically yielding scores of **3 or less** due to the proximity or velocity parameters.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20052.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    }
}
``` 

In summary, the only immediate collision risk was from the obstacle 20052.0, which indicates an actual collision condition. No extreme risks were identified beyond that, indicating a manageable state for remaining obstacles with the exception of a few high-risk situations warranting continuous attention.
