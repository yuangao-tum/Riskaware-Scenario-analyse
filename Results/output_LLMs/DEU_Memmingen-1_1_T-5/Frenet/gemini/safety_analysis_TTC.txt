### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**General Notes:**  Since lateral distances are significantly larger than longitudinal distances for most obstacles and the ego vehicle seems to be on a different road/lane initially, lateral TTC and MDC are not as critical as longitudinal ones. However,  rapid lateral movement towards the ego vehicle's path deserves attention. A collision is considered imminent (score 0) if the DTClong is approximately 0 *and* the relative longitudinal velocity is negative (meaning the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle).
