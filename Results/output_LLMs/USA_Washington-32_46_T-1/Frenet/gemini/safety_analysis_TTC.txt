### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Methodology:**

For each obstacle, we analyze the risk based on Time-to-Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC).  Since we have both longitudinal and lateral components, we consider both. A negative TTC value indicates that the collision has likely already occurred or is imminent unless evasive action is taken. 

**Assumptions:**

* Constant velocity and acceleration are assumed for TTC calculations. This is a simplification, but necessary given the data provided.
*  MDC is approximated using the current distance, as more precise trajectory information is not available.
