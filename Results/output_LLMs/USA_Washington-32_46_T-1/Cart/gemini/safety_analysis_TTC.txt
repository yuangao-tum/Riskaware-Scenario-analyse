Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.1 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* **TTC Calculation:**  Since detailed velocity vectors (vx, vy) aren't provided, precise TTC is impossible. We'll approximate TTC based on current velocities and positions, assuming constant velocity and straight-line trajectories.  This simplification is a limitation.  A more robust analysis would require velocity vectors and predicted trajectories.
* **MDC Calculation:** We'll use Euclidean distance between ego and obstacle positions as a proxy for MDC.  Again, this is a simplification, as the true MDC would consider vehicle shapes and trajectories.
* **Lanelet Context:**  Lanelet information helps identify potential conflicts, but without lanelet shapes and road geometry, precise risk assessment is limited.  We'll assume objects in different lanelets pose less risk unless their positions suggest a potential crossing path.
* **Relative Direction/Velocity:** Due to lack of detailed directional information for velocities, I am unable to assess if the obstacles are closing towards the ego or are moving away. I am also unable to determine which obstacles are ahead of the ego.



### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30555
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet. Distance is moderately far, but further analysis with proper trajectories is needed.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  TTC cannot be accurately calculated without velocity vectors. Assuming constant velocity, the obstacle is stationary, meaning if the ego maintains its current trajectory it *could* eventually collide with it.
