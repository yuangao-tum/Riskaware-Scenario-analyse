Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.1 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30555.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is located within lanelet 931.0, which is not in the direct trajectory of the ego vehicle, making it unlikely to present a risk.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary; hence, there is no imminent collision risk.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 30556.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Similarly, this obstacle is in lanelet 308.0 and does not intersect the path of the ego vehicle.

   - Time Risk reason: Stationary; no collision risk.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

3. **Obstacle ID: 30557.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is moving at a relative speed and is located in lanelet 929.0, but the trajectories do not intersect directly with the ego vehicle's intended path.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: It has a low relative speed; thus, the TTC is significant enough to indicate that the situation is manageable.
   - Time safety score: 4
   - Overall Risk score: 4

4. **Obstacle ID: 30558.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Another moving object in lanelet 929.0 moving in a parallel direction and not directly threatening the ego vehicle.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving but is lateral to the ego's path, making it non-threatening in this timeframe.
   - Time safety score: 4
   - Overall Risk score: 4

5. **Obstacle ID: 30559.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Same as above; it is lateral and sufficiently far away from the ego vehicle.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: Despite being in motion, it poses no immediate risk.
   - Time safety score: 4
   - Overall Risk score: 4

6. **Obstacle ID: 30560.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Stationary and located well outside the projection of the ego vehicle's path (lanelet 307.0).
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: Again, as stationary, there is no risk of collision here.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

7. **Obstacle ID: 30561.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is moving very slowly and is still outside the intended path of the ego vehicle.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: The TTC is acceptable, as the ego can react timely.
   - Time safety score: 4
   - Overall Risk score: 4

8. **Obstacle ID: 30562.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is significantly distant from the ego vehicle's current trajectory.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: Although moving, the distance is ample, allowing for a large TTL.
   - Time safety score: 4
   - Overall Risk score: 4

9. **Obstacle ID: 30563.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Another stationary obstacle not within the direct path of the ego.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: No motion indicates no risk here as well.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

10. **Obstacle ID: 30564.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: This is stationary, far away in another lanelet.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: No collision risk as it is static.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

11. **Obstacle ID: 30565.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Moving obstacle, but it does not pose any threat as it will not cross paths with the ego vehicle.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Although moving, the relative distance makes collision unlikely.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

12. **Obstacle ID: 30566.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Similar to previous, it's too far and positioned in a non-threatening way.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Moving but not threatening; distance is sufficient.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

13. **Obstacle ID: 30567.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: While moving, it is positioned too far to threaten collision.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Relative motion creates no risk of collision.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

14. **Obstacle ID: 30568.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: This one's trajectory will not intersect with the ego vehicle's.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Though moving, it poses no risk as it will remain out of the path of the ego vehicle.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

15. **Obstacle ID: 30569.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Yet another moving object well outside the path.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Distance ensures no immediate concern.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

16. **Obstacle ID: 30570.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Very close by but remains stationary, giving no immediate risk.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Stationary with ample distance prevents any collision.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

17. **Obstacle ID: 30571.0**

    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Sufficient TTC to avoid high concern levels.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

18. **Obstacle ID: 30573.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Its speed does not pose a threat at present distance.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: At this distance, the time allows for corrective action if necessary.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

19. **Obstacle ID: 30574.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Stationary and far removed from the ego vehicleâ€™s path.
