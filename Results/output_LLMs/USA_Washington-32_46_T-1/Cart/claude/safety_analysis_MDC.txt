Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.1 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario and evaluate collision risks:

1. Initial Situation Analysis:
- Ego vehicle is traveling in lanelet 302.0
- Initial position around (-334.79, 278.96)
- Multiple obstacles present in various lanelets

2. Key Risk Analysis:
- Most relevant obstacle: 30570.0, which is in the same lanelet (302.0) as ego vehicle
- Other obstacles are either in different lanelets or at safe distances

Detailed Analysis for the most critical obstacle (30570.0):

Time to Collision (TTC) Analysis:
- Longitudinal separation is maintained
- Both vehicles moving in same direction
- Relative velocity is manageable
- TTC > 5 seconds

Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) Analysis:
- Initial separation sufficient
- No immediate collision risk
- Lateral separation maintained

Safety Scores for Obstacle 30570.0:
- Distance Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)
  Reason: Adequate longitudinal separation maintained
- Time Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)
  Reason: TTC values indicate sufficient reaction time
- Overall Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)

Other notable obstacles show no immediate collision risks as they are either:
1. In different lanelets
2. Moving in different directions
3. Maintaining safe distances

Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Conclusion:
The scenario shows no immediate collision risks or extreme risk situations. The ego vehicle maintains safe distances from all obstacles, and the traffic flow appears to be well-regulated. No obstacles received risk scores of 0 or 1, indicating absence of immediate collision threats or extreme risks.

Key Safety Recommendations:
1. Continue monitoring relative positions with obstacle 30570.0
2. Maintain current safe following distances
3. Keep monitoring cross-traffic at intersection points
