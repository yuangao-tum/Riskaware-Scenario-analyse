### Safety analysis for timestep 2.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 42.89 m longitudinally and 10.72 m laterally away, indicating a safe distance.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away with a positive longitudinal relative velocity (8.4 m/s) and a lateral motion (2.85 m/s) of moving away, resulting in a high TTC.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4

2. **Obstacle ID: 36.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 36.5 m longitudinally and 12.67 m laterally away, considered a safe distance for now.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle with negative longitudinal velocity (-3.5 m/s) which indicates a potential risk. However, the distance is still considerable, leading to a moderate TTC.
   - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 3

3. **Obstacle ID: 37.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The relative distances (3.69 m longitudinally and 32.13 m laterally) indicate this vehicle is very close and poses a significant risk.
   - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: This obstacle has a negative longitudinal velocity (-2.58 m/s) causing a high likelihood of collision shortly, thus a very low TTC.
   - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 1

4. **Obstacle ID: 39.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The distance (46.21 m longitudinally and 15.2 m laterally) shows it is at a safe distance.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: This obstacle is closing in with -4.52 m/s longitudinally which makes it on a potential collision path, but the distance may still allow for reactions.
   - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 3

5. **Obstacle ID: 312.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 5.67 m longitudinally and 25.3 m laterally away, posing a significant imminent collision risk.
   - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Similar to obstacle 37.0, the negative longitudinal velocity (-2.58 m/s) suggests an increasing likelihood of collision.
   - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 1

6. **Obstacle ID: 330.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Distance is 29.5 m longitudinal and 10.85 m laterally, indicating current non-threatening space.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The negative relative velocity (-3.97 m/s) suggests a potential impact could occur, but relatively far away allowing for some reaction time.
   - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 3

7. **Obstacle ID: 344.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The vehicle is directly at 0.0 m longitudinally and -0.17 m laterally, indicating an immediate collision scenario.
   - Distance safety score: 0 (Collision)
   - Time Risk reason: With positive relative velocities (5.26 m/s longitudinally), the risk of collision is instantaneous, indicating an immediate need for action.
   - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 0

8. **Obstacle ID: 355.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Distance of 14.31 m longitudinally and -9.35 m laterally suggests that the vehicle is slightly encroaching into a threatening zone.
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The relative approach speeds (-0.66 m/s longitudinally and -6.32 m/s laterally) are critical but still manageable, suggesting timely reactions could prevent collision.
   - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 3

9. **Obstacle ID: 359.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: It is very close at 7.77 m longitudinally and perfectly aligned laterally.
   - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The longitudinal velocity (3.97 m/s) suggests a risk, though itâ€™s moving away laterally at a higher speed indicating time to avoid a collision can be managed.
   - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 2

10. **Obstacle ID: 363.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is behind and its distance suggests a manageable situation (33.56 m longitudinally behind).
    - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: The obstacle is approaching with a velocity of 1.59 m/s towards the ego vehicle, indicating potential for rear impact.
    - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 3
