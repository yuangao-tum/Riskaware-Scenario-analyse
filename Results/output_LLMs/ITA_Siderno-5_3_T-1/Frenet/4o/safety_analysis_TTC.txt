### Safety analysis for timestep 2.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

Let's calculate TTC (Time to Collision) and MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision) for each obstacle:

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is at a considerable distance (42.89 m longitudinally and 10.72 m laterally) and moving away longitudinally and laterally. This suggests minimal risk of collision due to increasing separation.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Since the obstacle is moving away with longitudinal and lateral positive relative velocities, the time to collision increases indefinitely, reducing the risk.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 36.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is 36.5 m longitudinally and 12.67 m laterally, yet moving toward the ego vehicle with negative relative velocity. However, given the distance, the collision risk is moderate.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: The negative longitudinal and lateral velocities indicate a decreased time to collision scenario that requires monitoring, but the current distance allows for reaction time.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 37.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle at 3.69 m longitudinal distance poses a significant risk even though lateral distance is high (32.13 m).
- **Distance Safety Score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Short longitudinal distance combined with negative relative velocity suggests imminent collision potential unless evasive action is taken.
- **Time Safety Score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 39.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is 46.21 m away longitudinally, sufficient to allow for corrective action, despite the approach velocity.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: While moving toward the ego car, negative velocities imply reduced TTC; however, the starting distance permits time for maneuvers.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 312.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: At 5.67 m longitudinally, the close proximity poses a high collision risk.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Negative velocities in proximity suggest a high likelihood of collision without quick intervention.
- **Time Safety Score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 330.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: At 29.5 m longitudinally, albeit with a negative velocity, there is a moderate risk of collision.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Negative velocities imply reducing TTC; hence, the situation requires timely attention.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 344.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Extremely close lateral distance (0.17 m) and exact longitudinal alignment create an immediate collision scenario.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Close lateral approach raises urgent collision potential without evasive action.
- **Time Safety Score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 1

#### Obstacle ID: 355.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Given the 14.31 m lateral and -9.35 m longitudinal placement, the risk is medium but manageable.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: While velocities suggest some approach, there is time to take preventive action.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 359.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: 7.77 m longitudinal but with a positive relative velocity reduces the immediacy of risk.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Positive relative velocity implies the obstacle is moving away, thus increasing TTC.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 363.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Although the obstacle is behind at 33.56 m, attention is required for lateral approach.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Positive velocities provide adequate time suggesting controllable collision risk.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4
