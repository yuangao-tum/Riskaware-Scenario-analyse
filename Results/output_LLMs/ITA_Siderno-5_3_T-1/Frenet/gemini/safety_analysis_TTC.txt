### Safety analysis for timestep 2.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30**
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively far away (42.89m longitudinal, 10.72m lateral) and moving away both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away, no TTC.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 36**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately far (36.5m longitudinal, 12.67m lateral) but closing in both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: TTClong is approximately 10.4s (36.5m / 3.5m/s).  Lateral motion is slow, reducing risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 37**
- Distance Risk reason: Very close longitudinally (3.69m) and moderately far laterally (32.13m).  Closing longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: TTClong is approximately 1.4s (3.69m / 2.58m/s). Poses a significant risk. No lateral movement.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 39**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far (46.21m longitudinal, 15.2m lateral) but closing in.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: TTClong is approximately 10.2s (46.21m / 4.52m/s). Lateral motion is slow, reducing risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 312**
- Distance Risk reason: Close longitudinally (5.67m) and moderately far laterally (25.3m). Closing longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: TTClong is approximately 2.2s (5.67m / 2.58m/s). Poses a moderate risk. No lateral movement.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 330**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately far (29.5m longitudinal, 10.85m lateral) but closing in both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: TTClong is approximately 7.4s (29.5m / 3.97m/s). Lateral motion is slow, reducing risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 344**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close laterally (-0.17m) and longitudinally aligned (0.0m) indicates a likely collision. Lateral movement is towards the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Immediate collision risk.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 355**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close (14.31m longitudinal, -9.35m lateral). Lateral movement is away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: TTClong is approximately 21.7s (14.31m / 0.66m/s).  Lateral motion is away, reducing risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 359**
- Distance Risk reason: Close longitudinally (7.77m) and laterally aligned.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, no TTClong.  Lateral motion needs careful monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 363**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far (33.56m behind, -7.53m lateral) and approaching from behind.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching from behind but not an immediate threat. Lateral motion needs careful monitoring.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
