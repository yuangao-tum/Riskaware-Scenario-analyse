Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.4 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories and obstacle dimensions are not provided, I'm making some simplified assumptions for illustrative purposes.  A real-world system would use more sophisticated calculations:

* **TTC Longitudinal (TTClong):**  Approximated by assuming constant velocity for both ego and obstacle and considering the relative longitudinal velocities and positions.
* **TTC Lateral (TTClat):** Approximated using relative lateral positions and assumed lane widths. Not calculated if obstacles are in different lanelets.
* **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):** Approximated based on current positions and assumed vehicle dimensions. Not precisely calculable without vehicle dimensions and shapes.
* **Lanelet Information:** Used to determine if obstacles are in the ego vehicle's path and for lateral TTC calculations.

**### Obstacle Analysis:**

- **Obstacle ID: 30.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is relatively far and in a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
