Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.4 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario for collision risks:

### Safety Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 344** (In same lanelet 46679 as ego):
- Distance Risk: High risk due to being in same lanelet and gradually closing distance
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk: Medium risk due to converging trajectories
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 2

2. **Obstacle 359** (In adjacent lanelet 48010):
- Distance Risk: Medium risk due to parallel movement
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk: Medium risk due to similar velocities
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

3. **Obstacle 363** (In same lanelet 46679):
- Distance Risk: Medium risk due to following path but maintaining distance
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk: Low risk due to stable following distance
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

4. **Obstacle 30** (In lanelet 46676):
- Distance Risk: Low risk due to different lanelet and trajectory
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk: Low risk due to diverging paths
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

Other obstacles show negligible risk (score: 5) due to:
- Being in different lanelets
- Static position (obstacles 37, 312)
- Maintaining safe distances
- No intersecting trajectories

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Key Findings:
1. No immediate collision risks (score 0) detected
2. No extreme risks (score 1) detected
3. Closest attention should be paid to Obstacle 344 due to being in the same lanelet and showing convergent trajectory
4. The scenario shows generally manageable risk levels with proper defensive driving

Recommendations:
1. Maintain current speed and trajectory
2. Monitor Obstacle 344's behavior closely
3. Be prepared for potential lane changes from adjacent vehicles
