Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.4 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.4: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**Obstacle ID: 30.0**
- **Distance Risk reason:** The distance between Ego and Obstacle 30.0 is approximately 36.1964 units, which indicates proximity but is manageable given Ego's velocity and direction.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** Given that Obstacle 30.0 is moving faster (11.34 m/s), the Time to Collision (TTC) is around 2.52 seconds, indicating a possible close-encounter scenario.
- **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

---

**Obstacle ID: 36.0**
- **Distance Risk reason:** The distance from Ego is approximately 36.854 and moving slower makes it less of a concern.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** The slow speed of Obstacle 36.0 and relative proximity of Ego makes the TTC manageable at about 6.37 seconds.
- **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

---

**Obstacle ID: 37.0**
- **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is stationary and at a distance of approximately 10.55 units.
- **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** As a stationary object, the TTC estimate is theoretically undefined, but the lack of movement enables moderate control.
- **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

---

**Obstacle ID: 39.0**
- **Distance Risk reason:** Approximately 39.1 units away, with relative motion indicating distance can be maintained.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** TTC is around 5.61 seconds, indicating no immediate danger.
- **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

---

**Obstacle ID: 312.0**
- **Distance Risk reason:** The distance of approximately 27.55 units provides enough space despite being stationary next to Ego.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** Similar to Obstacle 37.0, this stationary object simplifies risk potential.
- **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

---

**Obstacle ID: 330.0**
- **Distance Risk reason:** A distance of about 19.69 units suggests proximity but manageable.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** TTC is approximately 7.38 seconds given the slower velocity.
- **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

---

**Obstacle ID: 344.0**
- **Distance Risk reason:** Closest distance approximately 28.7 units, with a moving speed suggesting convergence.
- **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** The TTC is around 5.32 seconds, but quick movements may present a hoc risk.
- **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

---

**Obstacle ID: 355.0**
- **Distance Risk reason:** The distance is around 35.25 units, manageable but not without concern.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** The TTC is approximately 5.48 seconds, offering control.
- **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

---

**Obstacle ID: 359.0**
- **Distance Risk reason:** Approximately 25.57 units away with measures to control potential risks.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** TTC is about 4.26 seconds, manageable but requires vigilance.
- **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

---

**Obstacle ID: 363.0**
- **Distance Risk reason:** With an approximate distance of 64.60 units, there is no immediate concern.
- **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** TTC is around 12.64 seconds, indicating ample time to react.
- **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
``` 

### Findings Summary
Throughout the analysis, no immediate collision risks (Overall Risk Score 0) or extreme risks (Overall Risk Score 1) were identified. However, several obstacles presented medium risks requiring active monitoring (Overall Risk Scores of 3) and numerous low risks that should be noted but are manageable (Overall Risk Scores of 4). Overall, the situation appears controllable with sufficient response time.
