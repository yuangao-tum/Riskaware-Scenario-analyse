Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.4 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is located in a different lanelet (46676.0) from the ego (48010.0), reducing collision risk. Distance to the ego is significant, but on an intersection path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Due to a high speed of the obstacle and crossing path, there's a potential future collision hazard, but time for corrective actions is available.
   - **Time safety score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

2. **Obstacle ID: 36.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in different lanelet (46677.0) and at a moderate distance, not directly in the path of ego.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity, reducing immediate collision risk; provides ample time to react.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 37.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In different lanelet and stationary, less chance of potential collision.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Stationary obstacle; no immediate time-induced crash threat.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

4. **Obstacle ID: 39.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in a different lanelet (46677.0) and traveling slowly; minor risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low speed, not necessitating immediate action, ensuring low collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4
  
5. **Obstacle ID: 312.0**  
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary in another lanelet, not anticipated to clash with the ego path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: As it's stationary, creating no time risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

6. **Obstacle ID: 330.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Different lanelet; low to moderate velocity; thus, a minor collision risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Sufficient time buffer due to separation distance.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

7. **Obstacle ID: 344.0**  
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Fast-moving across; direction diverging from ego's path, low likelihood collision.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Swift acceleration suggests low immediate interaction with the ego.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

8. **Obstacle ID: 355.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Approaching egoâ€™s lanelet at a moderate velocity but with a significant lateral separation.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative speed isn't enough to influence immediate risk to ego trajectory.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

9. **Obstacle ID: 359.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in the same lanelet (48010.0) as ego with moderate risk due to approaching paths and velocity.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3
   - **Time Risk reason**: Slightly higher velocities mean caution is advised, but collision risk is moderate.
   - **Time safety score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

10. **Obstacle ID: 363.0**  
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Far from the ego vehicle, traveling at a lower velocity.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Will not converge with ego trajectory due to significant spatial separation and divergent direction.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
``` 

Overall, all the obstacles present either negligible or manageable risk, considering the current scenario and positions relative to the ego vehicle.
