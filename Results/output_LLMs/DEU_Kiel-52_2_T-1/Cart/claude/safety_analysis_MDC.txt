Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.8 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario for potential collisions:

1. First, let's identify obstacles in the ego vehicle's vicinity:
- Ego vehicle is in lanelet 654/1977 throughout the trajectory
- Obstacle 30677 and 30675 share the same lanelet with ego vehicle
- Other vehicles are in adjacent or intersecting lanelets

2. Critical Analysis:

For Obstacle 30677:
- Distance Risk: Starts at moderate separation (~7m) but steadily decreases as both vehicles are in the same lanelet
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk: Decreasing relative velocity, but maintaining safe following distance
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

For Obstacle 30675:
- Distance Risk: Initially safe distance (~8m), maintaining steady gap
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk: Lower relative velocity, moving in same direction
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

For Other Obstacles:
- Most maintain safe distances in separate lanelets
- No immediate collision risks identified
- Overall Risk scores: 4-5

3. Notable Safety Concerns:
- The ego vehicle's deceleration from ~12.7 to 4.3 m/s indicates defensive driving
- No imminent collision scenarios detected
- Proper lane keeping behavior observed

4. Summary JSON:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Overall Safety Assessment:
- The scenario shows moderate risk levels but no immediate collision threats
- The ego vehicle maintains safe distances from surrounding vehicles
- Defensive driving behavior helps mitigate potential risks
- No obstacles present extreme or collision risks (scores of 0 or 1)
- The most significant risk comes from sharing lanelet with Obstacle 30677, but safe distances are maintained

The analysis suggests a well-managed traffic scenario with appropriate safety margins maintained between vehicles.
