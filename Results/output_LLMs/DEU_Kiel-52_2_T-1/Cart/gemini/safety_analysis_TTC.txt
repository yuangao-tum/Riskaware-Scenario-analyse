Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.8 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

*  Since precise trajectories, dimensions of vehicles, and lanelet shapes are not provided,  I will make reasonable assumptions based on the given positions, orientations, and velocities.  I will focus on relative motion and proximity as the primary indicators of risk. A more precise analysis would require the missing data.
* "Orientation" is assumed to be the heading angle in radians.
*  "Lanelet" information, while provided, isn't directly usable without knowing lanelet geometry.  I'll primarily rely on position and velocity differences.
* I will use a simplified risk assessment based on proximity and relative velocity, acknowledging that a real system would use more sophisticated methods.  A distance threshold and a TTC threshold will be considered for determining risk levels (not explicitly given in the prompt, therefore I'll use illustrative values.  A real autonomous vehicle would have these calibrated carefully).



**Illustrative Thresholds (Example - Adjust as needed for your system):**

* **Distance Threshold (High Risk):** 5 meters
* **TTC Threshold (High Risk):** 3 seconds


### Obstacle Analysis:

**General Notes:** Obstacle 30666 is closest to the ego vehicle and requires the most attention. Several other obstacles share the same or similar lanelets but are further away.  The analysis below uses approximate calculations based on the provided data.

- **Obstacle ID: 30664**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No immediate time-based risk based on current information.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30665**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately far from the ego vehicle.
