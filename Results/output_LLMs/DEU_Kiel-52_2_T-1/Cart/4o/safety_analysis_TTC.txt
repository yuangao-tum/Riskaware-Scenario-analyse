Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.8 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.8: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30664.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Positioned in a different lanelet than the ego. Based on position and lanelet difference, lateral distance is likely sufficient.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Given the higher velocity and acceleration, there is no immediate converging path with the ego.
  - Time safety score: 4
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30665.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Positioned ahead but in a different lanelet with significant lateral distance. 
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Moving away faster and in a non-converging trajectory.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30666.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Very close to ego (almost same coordinates) but still in different lanelet.
  - Distance safety score: 3
  - Time Risk reason: Slightly higher velocity, but given lateral non-alignment, moderate concern.
  - Time safety score: 3
  - Overall Risk score: 3

  - Distance Risk reason: Far ahead and different lanelet; lateral distance maintained.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Increasing speed but moving away.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30670.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Slightly lateral divergence, but the low potential for convergence.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Speed insufficient to catch up to ego quickly.
  - Time safety score: 4
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30671.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Significantly away longitudinally and laterally; changing path unlikely.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Paths don't converge rapidly; speed differential not critical.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30672.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Well behind ego in different lanelet.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Moving away; no intersect.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30674.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Well ahead and maneuvered off course.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Velocity moderate, path diverges even further.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30675.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Behind ego and off-path; moderate speed, poses little threat.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Acceleration decrease hints lower likelihood of path crossover.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30676.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Given lanelet and speed differences, good separation maintained.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Low velocity, decreasing acceleration; lower risk of conflict.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30677.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Moderate separation, situated behind.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Velocity suggests low capture capability in longitudinal trajectory.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30678.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Remote and off-path; fast enough but no crossover.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Flowing out of potential impact trajectory without chance of realignment.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30679.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Very distant with no interference.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Approaching faster paths but away from ego.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30680.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Far off-path and further away by significant measure.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Moving away with negligible crossing path.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30681.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Positioned behind and largely apart with slight closure.
  - Distance safety score: 5

  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

This scenario displays predominantly low-risk associations, characterized by separate lanes, differing velocities, and maintaining significant distances, resulting in no immediate or extreme collision threats.
