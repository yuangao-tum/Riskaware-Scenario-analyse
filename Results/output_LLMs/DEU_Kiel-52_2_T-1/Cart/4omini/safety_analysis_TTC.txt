Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.8 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.8 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

First, we identify the obstacles that could potentially collide with the ego vehicle by analyzing their positions and velocities. The ego vehicle is traveling with a velocity of 4.36 m/s and decelerating.
