### Safety analysis for timestep 3.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**General Note:**  A negative relative longitudinal velocity (Vrel_long) indicates the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally. A negative relative lateral velocity (Vrel_lat) indicates the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle from the left.  Positive values indicate moving away or approaching from the right.  This information is crucial for TTC calculations. We will consider a TTC value below 2 seconds as a high risk, 2-5 as medium, and above 5 as low. For MDC, values close to zero are high risk, while increasing distance reduces risk.


- **Obstacle ID: 30664.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind and to the left of the ego vehicle at a safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, slight lateral movement towards ego is not a significant risk given the initial distance.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30665.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  In front of ego and relatively far.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, slight lateral movement is not a concern given the distance.
