### Safety analysis for timestep 3.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 324.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far away longitudinally and laterally. Moving away in both directions.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No TTC risk as it's moving away.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 338.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Very close longitudinally (2.5m) and laterally far (32.51m), but moving towards the ego vehicle.  This poses a significant risk depending on the ego vehicle's width and the obstacle's trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally. TTC needs calculation but likely low. Lateral motion less concerning given the larger distance.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 341.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close longitudinally (-0.21m) and directly behind (0.0m lateral). Almost certainly a collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason:  Closing fast from behind.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 357.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close laterally (2.52m) and at the same longitudinal position. High risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  Lateral velocity is small, but the proximity poses a high risk. Longitudinal alignment means a collision is likely unless evasive action is taken.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 360.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close longitudinally (-12.5m) and very close laterally (-0.27m). Closing from behind and laterally.  This is a high-risk situation.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Closing from behind. TTC likely to be low.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 3104.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Laterally far (-23.24m) but moderately close longitudinally (13.01m). Moving closer longitudinally but away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Some longitudinal TTC risk but lateral motion is mitigating the risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3111.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close both longitudinally (13.44m) and laterally (6.16m). Moving closer in both directions, which presents a notable risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Closing relatively quickly longitudinally.  TTC needs calculation, but it could be low.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3118.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Farther away than 3111.0, both longitudinally (39.57m) and laterally (10.73m). Approaching but with more time to react.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Closing but with more time to react compared to closer obstacles.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3126.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Furthest obstacle. Low risk due to the distance both longitudinally (51.47m) and laterally (12.8m).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Closing but the distance provides ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
