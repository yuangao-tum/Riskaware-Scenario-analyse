## Safety analysis for timestep 3.1: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 324.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: The real distance is 31.99 m longitudinally and 5.82 m laterally, and the obstacle is moving away in both directions.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Given the relative velocity and acceleration, the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle, increasing the time to collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 338.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is quite close longitudinally at 2.5 m but is 32.51 m laterally. This proximity poses a risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is driving towards the ego vehicle with a moderate relative velocity, indicating a potential collision path.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle 341.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned directly behind at a near-zero longitudinal distance, posing an immediate risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 1
- **Time Risk reason**: Relative high velocity towards the ego vehicle, indicating an urgent collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 1
- **Overall Risk score**: 1

#### Obstacle 357.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Lateral distance of 2.52 m while being longitudinally aligned, suggesting minimal immediate collision risk as it moves away laterally.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away laterally, increasing time to collision.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle 360.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Closed distance of -12.5 m longitudinally, but with lateral motion towards the ego vehicle, requires attention.
- **Distance safety score**: 2
- **Time Risk reason**: High relative velocity towards the ego vehicle with lateral alignment indicates potential collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 2
- **Overall Risk score**: 2

#### Obstacle 3104.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located 13.01 m longitudinally but moving away laterally at -23.24 m, suggesting no immediate risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle moves laterally away, which decreases the likelihood of collision.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle 3111.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of 13.44 m and lateral distance of 6.16 m, but moving toward the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: With high relative speeds toward the ego vehicle in both directions, a potential collision path exists.
- **Time safety score**: 2
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle 3118.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is 39.57 m, and lateral is 10.73 m, with the motion toward the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Given the relative motion, manages collision avoidance can be strategized.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle 3126.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned 51.47 m longitudinally and 12.8 m laterally, approaching but still distant.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Slow relative closing velocity allows substantial time to react.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4
