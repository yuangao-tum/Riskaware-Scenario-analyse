### Safety analysis for timestep 3.1 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 324.0
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance of 31.99 m decreases with a relative velocity of 0.42 m/s, while the lateral distance of 5.82 m is increasing. Overall, this obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: With the relative velocities involved, it is clear that a collision will not occur due to the increasing distance. Thus, the Time to Collision (TTC) is positive.
  - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **4**

- **Obstacle ID**: 338.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 2.5 m, and lateral distance is 32.51 m. The obstacle is getting closer longitudinally at a relative velocity of -1.7 m/s and laterally at -2.82 m/s. A collision is likely due to the diminishing longitudinal distance.
  - Distance safety score: **2** (High Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The closeness of the longitudinal distance results in a decreasing TTC, indicating a high probability of impact.
  - Time safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **1**

- **Obstacle ID**: 341.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Negative longitudinal distance (-0.21 m) suggests that this obstacle is already very close, and given its relative velocity toward the ego vehicle, impact is imminent.
  - Distance safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Since the obstacle is colliding (-0.21 m), the TTC is effectively zero.
  - Time safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **1**

- **Obstacle ID**: 357.0
  - Distance Risk reason: At 2.52 m lateral distance and no longitudinal distance, this obstacle is currently next to the ego vehicle. Its relative velocity indicates it is moving away laterally.
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The longitudinal distance is effectively stationary, allowing for control of the situation, hence the TTC is manageable.
  - Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **4**

- **Obstacle ID**: 360.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinally, this obstacle is -12.5 m away, indicating it is approaching quickly from behind. The lateral distance of -0.27 m suggests very close proximity.
  - Distance safety score: **2** (High Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: With a negative longitudinal distance and high relative velocity of 4.88 m/s, the chance of impact is significant.
  - Time safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **1**

- **Obstacle ID**: 3104.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 13.01 m with a relative velocity of -0.5 m/s and lateral distance is -23.24 m, indicating movement towards the ego vehicle but with distance maintained.
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Although it is moving toward the ego vehicle, the longitudinal distance is sufficient, and thus the time to collision remains positive.
  - Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **4**

- **Obstacle ID**: 3111.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance at 13.44 m and moving towards the ego vehicle laterally indicates a moderate risk of collision.
  - Distance safety score: **3** (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The TTC is decreasing due to the negative velocity of the obstacle; however, thereâ€™s still time to mitigate collision.
  - Time safety score: **3** (Medium Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **3**

- **Obstacle ID**: 3118.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Similar to the previous obstacle, it is approaching but at a significant distance (39.57 m longitudinally).
  - Distance safety score: **3** (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The TTC values indicate that while it is approaching, there is still ample time to react.
  - Time safety score: **3** (Medium Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **3**

- **Obstacle ID**: 3126.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Far distance of 51.47 m longitudinally provides a strong buffer against collision despite the threat of approach.
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Alongside the good distance, the relative velocities do not indicate imminent impact.
  - Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **4**
