Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.1 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories and shapes of vehicles are not provided, I'm making simplified assumptions for this analysis. I'll primarily use Euclidean distance and relative velocities for a preliminary risk assessment.  A more robust analysis would require detailed trajectory predictions, vehicle dimensions, and inter-vehicle orientations.  For TTC and MDC calculations, I'm assuming straight-line motion for simplification, which might not reflect real-world scenarios perfectly.

**Calculations**:

To provide a more accurate risk score calculation, some placeholder or estimated values for TTC and MDC are required. Please provide these values if available. In their absence, I'm making some broad estimations for demonstrative purposes.

* **DTC (Distance to Collision)**: Calculated as the Euclidean distance between the ego vehicle and the obstacle.
* **TTC (Time to Collision)**: Estimated based on relative velocity and DTC. If the relative velocity is close to zero or the vehicles are moving away from each other, TTC is set to a high value signifying no immediate risk.
* **Scoring**:  Scores are assigned based on rough estimations, prioritizing closer proximity and high closing speeds as higher risk.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 324.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Moderately far, but in a different lanelet, indicating some separation.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason:  Assuming moderate relative velocity based on different lanelets, TTC is likely moderate.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4
