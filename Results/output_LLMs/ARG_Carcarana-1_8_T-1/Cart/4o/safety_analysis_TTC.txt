Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.1 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.1: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 324.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 324.0 is in a different lanelet, minimizing the immediate collision risk. The distance is relatively safe.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The orientation and velocity suggest it travels parallel without imminent lateral collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 338.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in a different lanelet and significantly south of the Ego vehicle. The distance is safe.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The trajectory and orientation indicate it is not on a collision path with the Ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 341.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in the same lanelet with substantial velocity, increasing potential risk if it continues towards Ego.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Similar direction with significantly higher speed requires attention for possible collision paths.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 357.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Shares proximity and similar direction, but in a different lanelet. Requires attention due to close lateral positioning.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Slight speed difference but not directly aligned for collision.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 360.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Different lanelet and currently no aligned path for collision.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Divergence in path and lanelet offers no time-based collision threat.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3104.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Safe distance in a different lanelet; moving in a non-converging path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: High relative speed but a different direction; poses no immediate collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3111.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: In a different lanelet and poses no immediate collision threat due to position.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Fast speed but moving away from Ego; no time-based direct threat.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3118.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in a different lanelet with significant distance; safe for now.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: High speed but non-converging path relative to Ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3126.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: In a different lanelet, so not an immediate threat.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: No converging path observed with significant speed.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5
