### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 3298.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 10.1 m with the obstacle moving directly towards the ego vehicle with no lateral distance. This places it directly in the collision path.
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: With a relative velocity of -3.14 m/s and approaching acceleration, the TTC is approximately 3.22 seconds (10.1 m / 3.14 m/s), which signals a high risk of collision if no maneuvers are made.
- **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

#### Obstacle 3299.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is 26.71 m in front and 28.63 m laterally away, with no significant lateral motion. It's far enough not to pose immediate danger.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity is towards the ego, but given the large initial separation, the TTC is lengthy, making timely interventions possible.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle 3300.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: With a longitudinal distance of 9.96 m and lateral distance of 8.9 m, it poses a moderate collision risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Given the same velocity conditions as other obstacles and similar distances, TTC is around 3.17 seconds. There is moderate risk.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle 3301.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is only 0.14 m away, directly in the path. This is an immediate collision.
- **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: At a velocity of -0.98 m/s with negligible space, collision is occurring immediately.
- **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### Obstacle 3303.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located 26.92 m in front with substantial lateral separation of 36.5 m. It's moving towards laterally but far enough for control.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Due to distance and motion, even with similar velocity characteristics, there is ample time to react, resulting in a low risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle 3304.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Separated by 30.19 m and 28.55 m laterally, the obstacle isn't posing immediate risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: With significant spacing and the same velocity profile, time allows for evasive maneuvers, indicating low risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3301.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3301.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
```

Note: Obstacle 3301.0 is recorded under both Collision and Extreme risk due to the immediate proximity suggesting an overlapping definition in this scenario for Extreme Risk, listed as urgent concern requiring immediate preventative action.
