### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3298.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance (10.1 m) is close enough to indicate impending risk since the obstacle is moving toward the ego vehicle at a relative speed of -3.14 m/s. This distance is within a critical range that would warrant concern.
  - **Distance safety score**: **2** (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC can be calculated as \( \text{TTC}_{long} = \frac{D_{long}}{V_{rel,long}} = \frac{10.1 m}{3.14 m/s} \approx 3.21 \) seconds. Given that the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle, this is fairly urgent and poses a significant risk.
  - **Time safety score**: **2** (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: **2**

- **Obstacle ID: 3299.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance (26.71 m) offers a bit more space, but it's still potentially on a collision course. The lateral position (-28.63 m) indicates it is approaching, but not too close yet.
  - **Distance safety score**: **3** (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC is calculated similarly: \( \text{TTC}_{long} = \frac{26.71 m}{3.14 m/s} \approx 8.51 \) seconds. Although there's time, the relative speed creates a notable risk, suggesting timely action may be required.
  - **Time safety score**: **3** (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: **3**

- **Obstacle ID: 3300.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is very close at a longitudinal distance of 9.96 m, indicating a direct concern for collision, especially considering its approach.
  - **Distance safety score**: **2** (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: \( \text{TTC}_{long} = \frac{9.96 m}{3.14 m/s} \approx 3.18 \) seconds. Urgent attention is needed due to the small distance and significant relative speed.
  - **Time safety score**: **2** (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: **2**

- **Obstacle ID: 3301.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: At a longitudinal distance of just 0.14 m, this obstacle is extremely close. The likelihood of collision is very high, confirming that this is an immediate danger.
  - **Distance safety score**: **1** (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is low (-0.98 m/s), which prolongs the time until impact: \( \text{TTC}_{long} = \frac{0.14 m}{|0.98 m/s|} \approx 0.14 \) seconds. Collision is imminent.
  - **Time safety score**: **1** (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: **1**

- **Obstacle ID: 3303.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance of 26.92 m and a lateral distance of -36.5 m suggest a safe distance at this moment, though it is approaching.
  - **Distance safety score**: **4** (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: This yields \( \text{TTC}_{long} = \frac{26.92 m}{3.15 m/s} \approx 8.55 \) seconds, indicating a manageable situation with enough time to act.
  - **Time safety score**: **4** (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: **4**

- **Obstacle ID: 3304.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: A longitudinal distance of 30.19 m gives a safe margin compared to other obstacles. There is no immediate concern since there isn't lateral movement.
  - **Distance safety score**: **4** (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Also calculated \( \text{TTC}_{long} = \frac{30.19 m}{3.14 m/s} \approx 9.62 \) seconds, which is sufficient time for monitoring.
  - **Time safety score**: **4** (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: **4**
