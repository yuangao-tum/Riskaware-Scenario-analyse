### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### - Obstacle ID: 3298.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is longitudinally 10.1 m ahead and laterally aligned (0.0 m). The proximity is close, indicating a significant risk.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Calculating TTC as \(TTC = \frac{Distance}{Velocity}\) = \( \frac{10.1 m}{|3.14 m/s|} \approx 3.21 s\). Low distance and high velocity contribute to high collision likelihood here.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

#### - Obstacle ID: 3299.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is longitudinally 26.71 m away and laterally -28.63 m. While it is farther than the previous obstacle, the angle introduces a potential collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: TTC calculated as \( \frac{26.71 m}{|3.14 m/s|} \approx 8.51 s\). Sufficient time reduces the risk of immediate collision.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

#### - Obstacle ID: 3300.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is longitudinally 9.96 m away and laterally -8.9 m. The close longitudinal distance indicates a higher risk, compounded by the lateral positioning.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: TTC calculated as \( \frac{9.96 m}{|3.14 m/s|} \approx 3.18 s\). This close distance and relative velocity indicate moderate collision risk.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

#### - Obstacle ID: 3301.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is extremely close at longitudinal 0.14 m, creating an immediate risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason: This situation presents an imminent collision; thus, TTC is negligible and collision is almost certain.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### - Obstacle ID: 3303.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is longitudinally 26.92 m away and laterally -36.5 m. Although distance seems manageable, lateral proximity heightens risk.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: TTC calculation yields \( \frac{26.92 m}{|3.15 m/s|} \approx 8.55 s\). This distance allows for sufficient time to act.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

#### - Obstacle ID: 3304.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is longitudinally 30.19 m away and laterally -28.55 m. Safe distance mitigates immediate collision risks.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: TTC is \( \frac{30.19 m}{|3.14 m/s|} \approx 9.62 s\). Adequate time to react minimizes the risk.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3301.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

In summary, Obstacle 3301 poses the most immediate risk, necessitating urgent attention, while others also present varying levels of risk based on their relative positions and speeds.
