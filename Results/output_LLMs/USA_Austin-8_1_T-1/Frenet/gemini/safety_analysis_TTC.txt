### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3298.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is in front and relatively close (10.1m longitudinally).
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Closing velocity is negative indicating movement towards the ego vehicle. Assuming constant velocity, TTC is approximately 3.2 seconds.  The negative acceleration suggests the closing speed will decrease, slightly improving the situation, but the TTC is still cause for concern.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 3299.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far away (26.71m longitudinally and 28.63m laterally).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally, the large distance and moderate relative velocity indicate ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3300.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close (9.96m longitudinally and 8.9m laterally).  The lateral distance somewhat mitigates the longitudinal risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Negative closing velocity is a concern, but the distance provides some buffer.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3301.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close longitudinally (0.14m).  Imminent collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Very low TTC due to the minimal distance and closing velocity.  Collision is highly likely.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 3303.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far (26.92m longitudinally and 36.5m laterally).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally, the large distance and moderate relative velocity allow for reaction time.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3304.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Far away (30.19m longitudinally and 28.55m laterally).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Longitudinal motion towards ego vehicle is present, but the distance provides a large safety margin.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
