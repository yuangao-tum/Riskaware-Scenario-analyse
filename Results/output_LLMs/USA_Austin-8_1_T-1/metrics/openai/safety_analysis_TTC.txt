Safety analysis for timestep 4.1 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3298
- Relative Direction: Front
- Distance Risk Reason: The longitudinal distance to collision is 10.1 (safe) and lateral distance is 0.0 (colliding), indicating immediate collision risk due to exact alignment. 
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: DSC = 5 * 1 + 0 * 0 = 5
- Time Risk Reason: The longitudinal time to collision is 3.22 (safe) and lateral time is 0.0 (immediate collision), indicating immediate collision risk due to exact alignment. 
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: TSC = 4 * 1 + 0 * 0 = 4
- Overall Risk Score: Risk Score = 0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 4 = 4.5 (rounded down to 4)
