Safety analysis for timestep 4.1 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 3298
- **Relative Direction:** Front
- **Distance Risk Reason:** The longitudinal distance to collision is 10.1, indicating a safe distance far from a collision. The lateral distance is 0.0, suggesting exact alignment. This leads to a LongDSC of 4 (Low Risk) and LatDSC of 5 (Negligible Risk).
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 4  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 5
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 4.5 (rounded to 5)
- **Time Risk Reason:** The longitudinal time to collision is 3.22 (Low Risk) and lateral is 0.0 (collision risk). This yields LongTSC of 4 and LatTSC of 0. Since LatTSC is 0, the overall time score is effectively 0.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 4
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 0
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 0
- **Overall Risk Score:** 2 (rounded down)

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 3299
- **Relative Direction:** Front-right
- **Distance Risk Reason:** The longitudinal distance to collision is 26.71, which is beyond 5, while the lateral distance is 28.63 (Negligible Risks). This gives LongDSC of 5 and LatDSC of 5.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 5
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 5
