Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.1 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1 seconds: 

Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**Obstacle ID: 3298.0**
- Distance Risk reason: The ego vehicle (position: (277.6476, 4.5387)) is approximately 54.9399 units away from the obstacle (position: (263.7075, 8.91)). The calculated lateral and longitudinal distances indicate that this obstacle is not in a direct path but is a nearby stationary object.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)

- Time Risk reason: Since the obstacle is stationary (velocity = 0.0), and the ego's velocity is 3.137 m/s, there is no immediate time to collision as this obstacle is not on a direct trajectory towards the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- Overall Risk score: 4

**Obstacle ID: 3299.0**
- Distance Risk reason: The distance to the obstacle at (256.9054, 42.7282) is about 61.0747 units away from the ego vehicle. Although this obstacle is significantly removed from the ego's lanelet, it is not directly in its path.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- Time Risk reason: This obstacle is also stationary and positioned far from the ego vehicle's movement path. The likelihood of a collision is negligible at this stage.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- Overall Risk score: 5

**Obstacle ID: 3300.0**
- Distance Risk reason: The distance from the ego vehicle to this obstacle at (266.9805, 18.8923) is approximately 46.9211 units, which suggests a further distance from the direct path but still within considering range.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)

- Time Risk reason: Similar to the above, since the obstacle is stationary and is not in the direct path of the ego vehicle, the TTC is effectively infinite.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- Overall Risk score: 4

**Obstacle ID: 3301.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle at (273.2173, 5.9283) is approximately 14.4303 units away from the ego vehicle. Given that both vehicles are in the same lanelet, a potential close encounter is noted.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- Time Risk reason: The obstacle has a velocity of 2.1561 m/s, which is approaching the ego vehicle if it continues its current trajectory. The distance and speed indicate a collision could occur relatively soon if both continue forward.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)

- Overall Risk score: 2

---

**Obstacle ID: 3303.0**
- Distance Risk reason: The distance from the ego vehicle to the obstacle (259.0532, 50.3012) is about 62.6482 units. This position is far enough to be less of an immediate concern.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- Time Risk reason: As this obstacle exhibits velocity (0.3835 m/s), it is moving, but it is not moving in a way that poses an immediate threat to the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- Overall Risk score: 5

---

**Obstacle ID: 3304.0**
- Distance Risk reason: The distance to this obstacle (253.5606, 43.6938) is 65.1031 units. This distance suggests more of a safe buffer and not in the way of the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- Time Risk reason: This obstacle is stationary and doesn't pose a risk of collision with the ego vehicle; therefore, the time is also infinitely safe.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- Overall Risk score: 5
