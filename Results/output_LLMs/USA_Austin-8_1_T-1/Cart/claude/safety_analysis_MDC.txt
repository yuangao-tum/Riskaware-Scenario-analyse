Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.1 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario and evaluate collision risks.

1. First, identifying relevant obstacles:
- Ego vehicle is in lanelet 431
- Obstacle 3298 and 3301 are in the same lanelet (431)
- Other obstacles are in different lanelets (725, 434, 2610, 2611, 726)

2. Detailed Analysis:

For Obstacle 3301 (Most critical):
- Initial position relative to ego: ~23m ahead in same lanelet
- Decelerating from 14.4 m/s to 2.1 m/s
- Similar orientation as ego vehicle (following same path)
- MDC: Minimum distance starts at ~23m and reduces to ~4m
- TTC: Given relative speeds and deceleration patterns, no immediate collision risk

Distance Risk reason: Although in same lanelet, maintains safe following distance
Distance safety score: 3

Time Risk reason: Obstacle is decelerating but maintaining safe gap
Time safety score: 3

Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

For Obstacle 3298:
- Stationary obstacle
- Located at significant distance (~60m ahead)
- MDC: Maintains large separation
- TTC: No immediate collision risk due to distance and ego vehicle's controlled deceleration

Distance Risk reason: Large separation maintained
Distance safety score: 4

Time Risk reason: Stationary but far enough for safe stopping
Time safety score: 4

Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Key Findings:
1. No immediate collision risks identified (no score of 0 or 1)
2. Main potential risk is with Obstacle 3301, but it maintains safe distance
3. Ego vehicle shows controlled deceleration from 15.1 m/s to 3.1 m/s
4. All other obstacles are in different lanelets with no intersection paths
5. The scenario shows overall safe behavior with proper spacing and speed management

The analysis indicates a well-controlled traffic situation with no extreme risks or imminent collisions. The ego vehicle's deceleration pattern suggests appropriate response to the traffic conditions ahead.
