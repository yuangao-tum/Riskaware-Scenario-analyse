Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.1 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* **TTC Calculation:**  Since detailed kinematic information (e.g., acceleration, heading changes over time) isn't fully available, a simplified TTC calculation is used, primarily based on current velocities and positions. More sophisticated methods would involve continuous trajectory prediction.
* **MDC Calculation:**  Euclidean distance is used as a proxy for MDC. For a more accurate MDC, detailed vehicle shapes and orientations would be required.
* **Lateral TTC and MDC are not specifically calculated**, as they are implicitly considered within the overall risk assessment based on lanelet information and relative positions within the lane.  A more rigorous analysis would involve lane boundaries and predicted trajectories.
* "Relative direction" implies whether the obstacle is moving towards or away from the ego vehicle.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3298**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet (431) as the ego vehicle, but significantly behind.  Lateral distance is also non-zero, reducing immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary, and the ego vehicle is moving forward.  No immediate time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3299**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (725),  presenting no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary and in a different lane. No time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3300**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (434), presenting no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary and in a different lane. No time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3301**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet (431) as the ego vehicle and relatively close. Both are moving forward, but ego vehicle is faster.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: While in the same lane, the ego vehicle's higher speed suggests it's pulling away, reducing the time-based risk. However, deceleration of both needs to be carefully considered.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3303**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (725), presenting no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving and in a different lane. No immediate time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3304**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (726), presenting no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary and in a different lane. No time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
