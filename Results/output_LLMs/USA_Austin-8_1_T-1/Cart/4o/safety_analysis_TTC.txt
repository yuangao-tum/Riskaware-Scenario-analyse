Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.1 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3298.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (431.0) as the ego vehicle. It is ahead with a lateral offset. The longitudinal distance is approximately 14 meters and lateral distance is around 4 meters.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk due to manageable longitudinal and lateral separation).
  - **Time Risk reason**: Obstacle is stationary with no acceleration; TTC longitudinal remains favorable due to ego’s deceleration.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk).
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3299.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is not in the same lanelet (725.0); its position is significantly offset in both longitudinal and lateral directions.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk due to significant separation).
  - **Time Risk reason**: No influence on TTC as it is lateral and not in the trajectory.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk).
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3300.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle in a different lanelet (434.0) with large lateral distance (approximately 14.3 meters).
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk due to large lateral separation).
  - **Time Risk reason**: Stationary and laterally positioned; does not influence the TTC longitudinally.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk).
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3301.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in the same lanelet (431.0) and moving, making it crucial. The longitudinal distance is approximately 4.4 meters.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk due to close proximity and position directly ahead).
  - **Time Risk reason**: As ego vehicle is slowing down, timely braking is critical to increase TTC. Initial TTC is short given the proximity and speeds.
  - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk).
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 3303.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is in another lanelet (725.0) and is considerably distanced laterally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk due to distance and lane difference).
  - **Time Risk reason**: Is trailing and laterally offset; doesn’t affect TTC.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk).
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3304.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Occupies a separate lanelet (726.0) with considerable lateral separation (around 39 meters).
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk).
  - **Time Risk reason**: Stationary, with no influence on TTC.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk).
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5
