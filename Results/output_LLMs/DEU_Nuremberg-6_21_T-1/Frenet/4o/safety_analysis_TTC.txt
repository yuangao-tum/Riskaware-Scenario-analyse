To evaluate the scenario accurately, I'll assess each obstacle using the provided metrics of Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC). Hereâ€™s the detailed safety analysis for each obstacle and the summary in JSON format if any of the obstacles are found to have a collision or extreme risk.

### Safety analysis for timestep 6.7 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
