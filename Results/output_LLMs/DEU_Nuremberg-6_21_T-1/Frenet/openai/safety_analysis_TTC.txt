### Safety analysis for timestep 6.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30784**
   - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is located 71.1 m longitudinally and -79.12 m laterally, indicating a significant distance exists, which reduces immediate collision risk.
   - Distance safety score: 4 
   - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC = 71.1 m / 7.66 m/s = 9.26 s; Lateral TTC = -79.12 m / 7.09 m/s = -11.15 s (indicates it is moving closer).
   - Time safety score: 3 
   - Overall Risk score: (4+3)/2 = 3.5 → **4**

2. **Obstacle ID: 30785**
   - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is located 81.81 m longitudinally and quite close (1.49 m) laterally.
   - Distance safety score: 4 
   - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC = 81.81 m / 7.01 m/s = 11.65 s; Lateral TTC = 1.49 m / 0 m/s (no lateral movement).
   - Time safety score: 4 
   - Overall Risk score: (4+4)/2 = 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 30789**
   - Distance Risk reason: Positioned at 41.16 m longitudinally and is directly in front, 0 m laterally, leading to higher risk.
   - Distance safety score: 3 
   - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC = 41.16 m / -1.6 m/s = -25.73 s (indicates it is moving forward, creating collision risk); Lateral TTC = 0 m / 3.19 m/s (directly in line).
   - Time safety score: 2 
   - Overall Risk score: (3+2)/2 = 2.5 → **3**

4. **Obstacle ID: 30790**
   - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 75.03 m longitudinally and 54.58 m laterally in front-left of the ego car.
   - Distance safety score: 4 
   - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC = 75.03 m / -6.31 m/s = -11.89 s; Lateral TTC = 54.58 m / -2.34 m/s = -23.34 (moving too close).
   - Time safety score: 2 
   - Overall Risk score: (4+2)/2 = 3 

5. **Obstacle ID: 30791**
   - Distance Risk reason: Positioned 91.18 m longitudinally and 11.02 m laterally (front-left), indicating low risk.
   - Distance safety score: 4 
   - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC = 91.18 m / -7.01 m/s = -12.99 s; Lateral TTC = 11.02 m / 0 m/s (no lateral motion).
   - Time safety score: 4 
   - Overall Risk score: (4+4)/2 = 4 

6. **Obstacle ID: 30794**
   - Distance Risk reason: Positioned at 95.35 m longitudinally and close laterally (-0.9 m), lower risk.
   - Distance safety score: 4 
   - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC = 95.35 m / -8.58 m/s = -11.12 s; Lateral TTC = -0.9 m / 5.14 m/s = 0.18 s.
   - Time safety score: 3 
   - Overall Risk score: (4+3)/2 = 3.5 → **4**

7. **Obstacle ID: 30802**
   - Distance Risk reason: Located at 17.95 m in front of the ego vehicle.
   - Distance safety score: 2 
   - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC = 17.95 m / -3.79 m/s = -4.74 s; Lateral TTC = irrelevant as it is aligned.
   - Time safety score: 1 
   - Overall Risk score: (2+1)/2 = 1.5 → **2**

8. **Obstacle ID: 30803**
   - Distance Risk reason: At a critical 0.23 m distance longitudinally, this represents a very high collision risk.
   - Distance safety score: 1 
   - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC = 0.23 m / -0.12 m/s = -1.92 s (very dangerous); Lateral TTC = 0 m.
   - Time safety score: 1 
   - Overall Risk score: (1+1)/2 = 1

#### Summary in JSON Format:
