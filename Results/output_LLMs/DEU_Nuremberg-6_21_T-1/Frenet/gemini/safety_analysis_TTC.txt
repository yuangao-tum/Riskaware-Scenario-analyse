### Safety analysis for timestep 6.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**Methodology:**

For each obstacle, we'll analyze the risk based on TTC and MDC.  Since we have longitudinal and lateral components, we'll consider both.  A negative TTC suggests the vehicles are moving towards each other. A small MDC indicates proximity and elevated risk.

We will use the following simplified equations to estimate TTC and MDC.  Note that these equations only provide a simplified approximation.  For a production-ready system, much more sophisticated analysis including higher-order derivatives and non-linear motion models would be necessary.

* **TTC = -DTC / Vrel** (Longitudinal and Lateral)
* **MDC ≈ |DTC + Vrel * TTC + 0.5 * Arel * TTC^2|** (Longitudinal and Lateral)



- **Obstacle ID: 30784.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Laterally distant (-79.12m) but longitudinally moderate (71.1m) and approaching in both directions. Front-right location poses a potential risk if lateral movement continues towards the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Negative TTC in both directions indicates closing. Longitudinal TTC (-71.1 / -7.66 ≈ 9.3s) suggests some time to react, but the lateral TTC (-79.12 / 7.09 ≈ -11.2s) indicates the vehicles are moving towards each other laterally. This needs monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30785.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Longitudinally distant (81.81m), negligible lateral distance (1.49m) raises concern, especially given the front-left position.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Negative longitudinal TTC (-81.81 / -7.01 ≈ 11.7s) provides reasonable time.  Lateral TTC is undefined due to 0 relative velocity, making lateral prediction challenging without higher-order information.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30788.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Laterally very distant (-95.73m) and longitudinally moderate (66.97m).  Front-right positioning and longitudinal closing needs observation.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal TTC (-66.97/-7.01 ≈ 9.5s) gives time to react.  No lateral movement makes lateral TTC undefined.  Higher-order dynamics needed for more precise lateral risk assessment.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30789.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Longitudinally close (41.16m) with negligible lateral distance.  Front position makes this a higher-risk obstacle.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal TTC (-41.16 / -1.6 ≈ 25.7s) is comfortable, but lateral TTC (-0 / 3.19=0s) is immediate and implies that there is a chance of collision unless evasive action is taken.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30790.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately distant both longitudinally (75.03m) and laterally (54.58m). The front-left position requires monitoring for converging trajectories.

- Time Risk reason: Negative TTC values longitudinally (-75.03 / -6.31 ≈ 11.9s) and laterally (54.58 / -2.34 ≈ -23.3s) indicate the vehicles are getting closer.  
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30791.0**

- Distance Risk reason:  Moderate longitudinal distance (72.59m) and very small lateral distance (3.45m). Front-left position and longitudinal closing pose a concern.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Negative longitudinal TTC (-72.59 / -5.21 ≈ 13.9s) suggests sufficient time. The small negative lateral TTC (-3.45 / -0.05 ≈ 69s) is very large, so almost no lateral relative motion.

- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30801.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Longitudinally close (24.26m) and small lateral distance (-20.91m).  Front-right position and converging paths elevates risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Negative longitudinal TTC (-24.26 / -1.49 ≈ 16.3s) is sufficient, but negative lateral TTC (-20.91 / 4.2 ≈ -5s) raises concern due to the short time and lateral closing.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2


- **Obstacle ID: 30802.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Longitudinally close (17.95m) with no lateral offset. Front position presents significant risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal TTC (-17.95 / -3.79 ≈ 4.7s) indicates relatively fast approach.  Lateral TTC is undefined due to 0 velocity, making accurate lateral assessment impossible.

- **Obstacle ID: 30803.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Extremely close longitudinally (0.23m) and negligible lateral distance. This indicates imminent collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Very small negative longitudinal TTC (-0.23 / -0.12 ≈ 1.9s). Lateral TTC is near zero.  Collision is almost certain without immediate action.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 30807.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Moderate distance behind (-26.74m) the ego vehicle with no lateral offset.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Positive longitudinal TTC (-(-26.74) / 2.33 ≈ 11.5s) signifies moving apart longitudinally, reducing risk. The negative lateral TTC (0 / -0.92 = 0s) indicates small lateral relative motion, which could be due to slight misalignment. In this case, TTC doesn't accurately reflect the risk. The car is behind the ego, so very unlikely for a collision.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 30808.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Longitudinally close (12.06m) and moderate lateral distance (-28.78m).  Front-right position and movement create elevated risk.
