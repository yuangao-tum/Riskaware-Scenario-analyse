Safety analysis for the last timestep (6.7 seconds):
To analyze the potential collisions, I will identify obstacles that are in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and calculate relevant safety metrics. The ego vehicle is in lanelet 485.0, so we will examine the following obstacles that are also in this lanelet:

- Obstacle 30797.0 (Position: (508.2453, 149.3242))
- Obstacle 30802.0 (Position: (497.0907, 146.606))
- Obstacle 30803.0 (Position: (479.7218, 143.0507))
- Obstacle 30807.0 (Position: (444.083, 137.8674))

### 1. Calculating Metrics
To calculate the metrics, we'll focus on Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) and Time to Collision (TTC) based on the positions and velocities of each obstacle.

- **Ego Vehicle State**:
    - Position: (475.0638, 142.1954)
    - Velocity: 7.0092
    - Acceleration: -4.2775

#### Calculation Details
Letâ€™s calculate the distance and relative velocity for each obstacle, which will help us derive TTC and MDC.

**Distance Formula**: 
\[ D = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \]

**Time to Collision (TTC)**:
- For Longitudinal Direction:
\[ TTC_{long} = \frac{D_{long}}{V_{rel}} \]
where \( D_{long} \) = Longitudinal Distance (difference in x-coordinates) and \( V_{rel} \) = Relative Velocity.

Given the velocity component of the obstacles is either stationary or moving, calculate the TTC accordingly.

**MDC** will simply be the distance calculated earlier. Values less than a threshold distance (chosen as 3 meters here) would indicate a collision risk.

### Safety Analysis for Timestep 6.7 seconds
Let's analyze each obstacle one by one.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 30797.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Forward-moving towards the ego vehicle
  - Distance safety score: 3.8 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Collision likely within 2.5 seconds due to relative velocity
  - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30802.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is relatively stationary but close enough to threaten
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Time until potential collision is managing over 2.5s due to the ego vehicle's deceleration.
  - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  
- **Obstacle ID: 30803.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Moving obstacle but has some distance, potential risk remains.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC exceeding 4 seconds with deceleration.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30807.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Further away in terms of longitudinal distance, moving speed lower.
  - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC is more than 5 seconds due to distant position and speed.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30797.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

### Final Comments
- The analysis shows an extreme risk with one obstacle (30797.0) indicating an immediate potential collision scenario.
- The rest of the obstacles present low to medium risks, indicating manageable situations with appropriate responses.
