Safety analysis for the last timestep (6.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 6.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories, vehicle dimensions, and lanelet geometries are unavailable, I'm making simplified assumptions for demonstration:

* **TTC (Time to Collision):** Approximated using relative velocities and distances in longitudinal (along ego vehicle's heading) and lateral directions.  A negative TTC indicates objects moving away from each other.  I'm using thresholds for TTC assessment (e.g., TTC < 2s considered high risk).
* **MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision):**  Approximated using Euclidean distance. Thresholds are used to assess risk (e.g., MDC < 2m is high risk).
* **Overall Risk Score:** Based on the combined TTC and MDC scores, prioritizing TTC as it represents the immediacy of the threat.

**Caveats:** This analysis is approximate.  A realistic evaluation necessitates detailed trajectory predictions, vehicle dynamics, and lane-level information.
