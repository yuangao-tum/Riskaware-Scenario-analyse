Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.2 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.2: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 31.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The ego vehicle's coordinates (208.677, -593.0588) are positioned significantly further on the x-axis than the obstacle's coordinates (197.34576, -614.04488). The lateral distance is decreasing as the obstacle is moving in the negative direction but it is not currently on a collision trajectory.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The velocity of the ego vehicle (1.7999) is less than the obstacle's velocity (1.8543312), and since the ego vehicle is moving at a slower speed, the TTC calculated shows no immediate risk of collision.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 35.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The distance from the ego vehicle is manageable with sufficient lateral space still available.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The TTC indicates that the ego vehicle will not collide with the obstacle within the next moments since it is slower and maintains a safe distance.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 36.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Similar to obstacle 35.0, there is a safe distance as the obstacle is moving away on a slight lateral adjustment.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The speed of the ego vehicle (1.7999) relative to the obstacle informs us of no immediate threat.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 310.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The ego vehicle is still showing safe distance due to the angular offset; no immediate change in trajectory.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Similar speeds and directions with no conflicts suggest adequate space to react.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 315.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Safe spatial distance exists although both vehicles are in close proximity laterally.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The matching velocities indicate a stable situation, no collision risk present.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 317.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The ego vehicle is in the clear; however, the obstacle is significantly faster and far off the direct line. 
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Despite the high speed, current positions signal no collision risk as time to intersection is delayed.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 320.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Same as before; the distance criteria are acceptable with no immediate threat.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The speeds point towards a non-threatening situation due to time margins.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 324.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Similar lanelet direction keeps the spacing ample, well managed.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Normal speeds among the vehicles yield no threat; ample time to react.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 355.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle presents a further distance away with a decreasing trajectory angle.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Slow have enough room to avoid potential collisions without pressure.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 357.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Situationally distant enough to negate an immediate conflict; positions separate substantially.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The time to collision is significantly broad based on the current trajectories hence no risk exists.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4
