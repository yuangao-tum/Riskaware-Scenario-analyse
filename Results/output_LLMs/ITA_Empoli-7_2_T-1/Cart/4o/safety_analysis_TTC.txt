Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.2 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.2: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 31.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned at a relatively close distance in a differing lanelet (6947.0). The trajectory suggests the obstacle is not directly converging with the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score: 4**
  - **Time Risk reason:** TTC suggests time is adequate before any potential conflict based on relative velocity and position.
  - **Time safety score: 4**
  - **Overall Risk score: 4**

- **Obstacle ID: 35.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Lanelet (6586.0) is different, and the obstacle is moving parallel or away with some longitudinal distance.
  - **Distance safety score: 4**
  - **Time Risk reason:** TTC values indicate a manageable time before any intersection would occur.
  - **Time safety score: 4**
  - **Overall Risk score: 4**

- **Obstacle ID: 36.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Parallel trajectory in a separate lanelet (6586.0), creating minimal conflict risk.
  - **Distance safety score: 4**
  - **Time Risk reason:** Adequate TTC ensures there's no immediate risk of collision.
  - **Time safety score: 4**
  - **Overall Risk score: 4**

- **Obstacle ID: 310.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Close proximity, but in a distinct lanelet (6586.0), implies low collision path intersection probability.
  - **Distance safety score: 4**
  - **Time Risk reason:** With current velocities and directions, the need for immediate response is low.
  - **Time safety score: 4**
  - **Overall Risk score: 4**

- **Obstacle ID: 315.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned in lanelet 6586.0, maintaining a consistent path that does not intersect with the ego vehicle imminently.
  - **Distance safety score: 4**
  - **Time Risk reason:** Sufficient TTC, providing leeway for adjustments and maneuvers.
  - **Time safety score: 4**
  - **Overall Risk score: 4**

- **Obstacle ID: 317.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Located ahead in a different lanelet (3399.0) moving forward at higher velocity reducing direct collision potential.
  - **Distance safety score: 5**
  - **Time Risk reason:** High velocity and forward position result in negligible interaction threat in a given timeframe.
  - **Time safety score: 5**
  - **Overall Risk score: 5**

- **Obstacle ID: 320.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Lanelet 3399.0 with further positioning preventing overlap with the ego vehicle's path.
  - **Distance safety score: 5**
  - **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocity is sufficiently high to prevent a collision scenario.
  - **Time safety score: 5**
  - **Overall Risk score: 5**

- **Obstacle ID: 324.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned significantly ahead in a separate lanelet (3399.0), mitigating any immediate conflict.
  - **Distance safety score: 5**
  - **Time Risk reason:** Given the distance and velocity, time to collision assessment shows negligible risk.
  - **Time safety score: 5**
  - **Overall Risk score: 5**

- **Obstacle ID: 355.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** A part of lanelet 6586.0 with parallel movement reduces likelihood of collision course.
  - **Distance safety score: 4**
  - **Time Risk reason:** Velocity and orientation ensure that any real collision threat is not present.
  - **Time safety score: 4**
  - **Overall Risk score: 4**

- **Obstacle ID: 357.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Distant position in lanelet 7266.0, moving in a distinct pattern limits direct interaction risk.
  - **Distance safety score: 5**
  - **Time Risk reason:** High velocity in a different direction avoids any immediate temporal collision risk.
  - **Time safety score: 5**
  - **Overall Risk score: 5**
