Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.2 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.2s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* To perform a comprehensive TTC and MDC calculation, we need more than just position and velocity.  Crucially, we need the dimensions of the ego vehicle and obstacles (length, width) and their precise trajectories (not just current lanelet).  Since this information is missing, I will make reasonable assumptions and provide a qualitative analysis.
* "Longitudinal" TTC/MDC refers to the direction of travel within the lanelet. "Lateral" TTC/MDC refers to the perpendicular direction.  Since exact trajectories are unknown, I'll approximate these based on current positions and orientations.
* I will assume a generic safety "bubble" around the ego vehicle.  A very close proximity, even if not an immediate collision, will be flagged as high risk.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 31.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is relatively close and in a potentially conflicting lanelet.  Further investigation is needed to determine precise lateral separation and future trajectories.
    - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Time Risk reason:  Without trajectory information, TTC is difficult to estimate precisely. The proximity suggests a moderate time risk.
    - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 35.0, 36.0, 310.0, 315.0**  (Grouped due to proximity and similar lanelet)
    - Distance Risk reason: These obstacles are clustered near the ego vehicle, and share a lanelet that may intersect or merge with the ego's trajectory. This cluster represents a higher risk due to the potential for complex interactions.
    - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: The close proximity and unknown future trajectories make the time risk significant.  Detailed trajectory prediction is necessary to assess the likelihood of these obstacles merging into the ego's path.
    - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 317.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet and further away, posing less of an immediate threat. However, its high velocity warrants attention.
    - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Time Risk reason:  The high velocity of obstacle 317.0 increases the time risk, particularly if its trajectory intersects with the ego vehicle's path.
    - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 320.0, 324.0** (Grouped due to similar lanelet and moderate distance)
    - Distance Risk reason: These obstacles are further away than the previous cluster and moving in the same general direction as the ego vehicle.
    - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: Moderate velocity and greater distance suggest a lower time risk.
    - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 355.0, 357.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: While the high velocity of obstacle 357.0 raises concern, it seems to be in a different lanelet from the ego and moving in a different direction. Obstacle 355 also seems in a different lanelet. More information is required.
    - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: The high velocities increase the time risk, but trajectory information is crucial to accurately assess this.
    - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)
