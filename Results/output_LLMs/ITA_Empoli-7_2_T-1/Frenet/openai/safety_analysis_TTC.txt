### Safety analysis for timestep 2.2 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Obstacle Analysis:**
1. **Obstacle ID: 31.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The DTC values are 12.61 m (longitudinal) and 15.0 m (lateral), which indicate a moderate distance from the ego vehicle.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: TTC longitudinal = 12.61 m / -2.13 m/s = -5.91 seconds (indicating a negative value, suggesting the car is already in conflict) and TTC lateral = 15.0 m / -1.82 m/s = -8.24 seconds. Thus, it is possible for collision since TTC is negative.
   - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 35.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: DTC of 14.77 m (longitudinal) and -13.63 m (lateral) suggests it is edging closer to collision as it encroaches towards the ego vehicle.
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: TTC longitudinal = 14.77 m / -1.73 m/s = -8.54 seconds; TTC lateral = -13.63 m / 1.65 m/s = -8.27 seconds indicates potential collision risk.
   - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 36.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: DTC longitudinal is 12.66 m, while lateral is -13.14 m, indicating a possibility of lateral collision.
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: TTC longitudinal = 12.66 m / -1.68 m/s = -7.55 seconds; TTC lateral = -13.14 m / 2.7 m/s = -4.87 seconds indicates a strong risk of collision.
   - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 310.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: It has a DTC of 14.11 m longitudinally and 0.0 m laterally; the lateral distance means a direct risk.
   - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: TTC longitudinal = 14.11 m / -1.7 m/s = -8.29 seconds; lateral TTC is negligible, indicating high collision risk.
   - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 315.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: DTC of 15.04 m (longitudinal) and -9.67 m (lateral), poses a threat of lateral impact.
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: TTC longitudinal = 15.04 m / -1.71 m/s = -8.80 seconds; TTC lateral = -9.67 m / 1.72 m/s = -5.62 seconds indicates a high risk of collision.
   - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID: 317.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: It is behind the ego car with a longitudinal distance of -0.27 m suggesting extreme proximity.
   - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The TTC would be redundant since the distance is negative, indicating it's very likely to collide.
   - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

7. **Obstacle ID: 320.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: DTC of -19.74 m (longitudinal) suggests encroachment from behind.
   - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Similar to above, negative distance indicates extreme likelihood of collision.
   - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

8. **Obstacle ID: 324.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: DTC longitudinal of -38.68 m showing a backward approach.
   - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Neglected distance means the vehicle is impacted.
   - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

9. **Obstacle ID: 355.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: DTC longitudinal is 16.86 m and laterally 17.57 m showing it is moving away.
   - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle indicates no imminent collision.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

10. **Obstacle ID: 357.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: It has a DTC of 25.52 m longitudinally and 0.0 laterally, posing a guiding caution.
    - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: TTC longitudinal = 25.52 m / -11.67 m/s = -2.18 seconds; thus indicating a potential issue approaching.
    - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)
