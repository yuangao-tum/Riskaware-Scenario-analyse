### Safety analysis for timestep 2.2: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 31.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned front-left at a longitudinal distance of 12.61 m and a lateral distance of 15.0 m. While relatively close, it's not in the immediate path.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity indicates it's approaching, but with velocities of -2.13 m/s longitudinal and -1.82 m/s lateral, it provides enough time to react.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 35.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Front-right position, with relative distances of 14.77 m longitudinal and -13.63 m lateral, and closing distance isn't too critical.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Approaching at a longitudinal velocity of -1.73 m/s; lateral velocity makes impact unlikely.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 36.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Located front-right, distances at 12.66 m (longitudinal) and -13.14 m (lateral), suggests an avoidable path.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity longitudinally -1.68 m/s and laterally 2.7 m/s, moving diagonally away.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 310.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Directly in front at 14.11 m, but with lateral movement, itâ€™s not in a direct collision path.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal velocity -1.7 m/s suggests gradual closure, lateral velocity moving away.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 315.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Front-right position; sufficiently apart with 15.04 m longitudinal and -9.67 m lateral clearance.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity indicates slight approach, but manageable.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 317.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Nearly no gap behind at -0.27 m, a critical situation.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Fast relative approach from behind with 5.06 m/s velocity.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 320.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Rear-left placement at -19.74 m longitudinal and 0.48 m lateral. Safe distance.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Approaching slowly at 2.72 m/s, offering significant time.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 324.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Far rear-left, outside immediate concern with longitudinal distance of -38.68 m.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Moves closer slowly with negligible speed toward the ego vehicle.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 355.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Situated front-left at 16.86 m and diverging laterally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Lateral velocity at 9.0 m/s increasing distance, moving obstacles away.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 357.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Ahead at 25.52 m, but fast closure may pose risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: High approach speed of -11.67 m/s longitudinally and a lateral influence.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
