### Safety analysis for timestep 6.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 3655.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 0.17 m, and the lateral distance is -1.88 m. This indicates the obstacle is very close to the ego vehicle, posing a significant collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative speed is -0.26 m/s longitudinally, leading to a calculated TTC of 0.65 seconds (0.17 / 0.26), which indicates an imminent collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3656.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 9.01 m and lateral distance is 10.26 m. This distance provides a moderate safety margin.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity results in a TTC of 34.65 seconds (9.01 / 0.26), indicating a low probability of collision, allowing ample time to react.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3657.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 0.84 m and lateral distance is -5.38 m. Close proximity poses a risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC is 3.23 seconds (0.84 / 0.26), which gives some time but very little margin.
  - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3658.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 0.24 m. This puts the obstacle extremely close with no lateral offset.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC here is critical at 0.92 seconds (0.24 / 0.26), indicating an almost certain collision without mitigation.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3659.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is 0.32 m and lateral distance is 1.9 m, indicating an imminent risk of collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC is also low at 1.23 seconds (0.32 / 0.26), necessitating immediate action.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3660.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is 12.51 m with significant lateral distance provides a safe margin of distance.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC of 48.56 seconds (12.51 / 0.26) indicates a safe situation with time to evade.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3661.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is 16.02 m and lateral distance is 10.2 m, indicating a safe margin.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC of 61.65 seconds (16.02 / 0.26) suggests low collision risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)
