### Safety analysis for timestep 6.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 3655.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is a mere 0.17 m, which indicates a very immediate risk as it is extremely close to the front-right of the ego vehicle. The lateral distance of -1.88 m suggests it is not directly in the path but very close laterally.
- **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: With a relative velocity of -0.26 m/s toward the ego vehicle, the situation indicates an immediate collision if no evasive action is taken. Given the immediate proximity (0.17 m longitudinally), TTC is very short.
- **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 3656.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: A longitudinal distance of 9.01 m and lateral distance of 10.26 m signifies the obstacle is further away and to the side, not directly in the collision path.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: With the same relative velocity of -0.26 m/s, the obstacle does not represent a significant immediate threat due to the greater distance. TTC is manageable.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 3657.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is 0.84 m, which is dangerously close to the front-right but slightly further than Obstacle 3655.0. Lateral distance of -5.38 m indicates it is somewhat offset from the direct path.
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's longitudinal proximity along with a modest closing speed implies an urgent need for response. TTC is short albeit slightly longer than for 3655.0.
- **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 3658.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: A longitudinal distance of 0.24 m presents an extreme risk as it is directly in front of the ego vehicle. There is no lateral offset.
- **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is aligned directly ahead with a short TTC due to its proximity, indicating an immediate risk of collision.
- **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 3659.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of 0.32 m is critically close but not aligned laterally in the direct path (lateral distance of 1.9 m). Still presents high risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Although not directly centered, lateral movement is negligible, making the short longitudinal distance dangerous with a moderate TTC.
- **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 3660.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: At 12.51 m longitudinally and 10.23 m laterally, this obstacle's risk is considerably lower due to its further distance and lateral offset.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity towards ego vehicle combined with larger distance keeps TTC comfortably high, minimizing risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 3661.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Similar to Obstacle 3660.0, with a longitudinal distance of 16.02 m and lateral distance of 10.2 m, indicating minimal immediate threat.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's motion and distance mean high TTC, reducing collision probability with present conditions.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3655.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
```

Both obstacles 3655.0 and 3658.0 present extreme risk, with very limited time for collision avoidance, though only 3655.0 is selected for the JSON representation.
