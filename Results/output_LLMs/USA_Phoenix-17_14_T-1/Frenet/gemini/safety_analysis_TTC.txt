### Safety analysis for timestep 6.6: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3655**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close longitudinally (0.17m) and laterally within close proximity (-1.88m) in the front-right.  High risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -0.26 m/s, leading to a very short TTC if the speeds remain constant.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 3656**
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively safe distance, both longitudinally (9.01m) and laterally (10.26m) in the front-left.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Although approaching longitudinally, the distance provides ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3657**
- Distance Risk reason: Close longitudinal distance (0.84m) and moderate lateral distance (-5.38m) in front-right. Poses a collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal velocity indicates approach, increasing risk with the short distance.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 3658**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close longitudinally (0.24m) and directly in front (0.0m lateral).  Imminent collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason:  Directly approaching longitudinally, extremely high risk of immediate collision.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 3659**
- Distance Risk reason:  Very close longitudinally (0.32m) and close laterally (1.9m) in the front-left. Very high collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally, posing a very high risk given the close proximity.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 3660**
- Distance Risk reason: Safe distance both longitudinally (12.51m) and laterally (10.23m) in the front-left.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Although closing in longitudinally, the current distance provides sufficient time to react.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3661**
- Distance Risk reason: Safe distance, both longitudinally (16.02m) and laterally (10.2m) in front-left.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  While approaching, the large distance provides ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
