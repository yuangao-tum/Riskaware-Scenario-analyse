### Safety analysis for timestep 6.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID**: 3655.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance (0.17 m) is extremely close to the ego vehicle. The lateral distance (-1.88 m) indicates the obstacle is very close on the right side, suggesting an immediate risk of collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1
  - **Time Risk reason**: Given the longitudinal distance is 0.17 m and the relative velocity is -0.26 m/s, the TTC is calculated as \( \frac{0.17}{0.26} \approx 0.65 \) seconds. This indicates a high likelihood of immediate collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 1
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 3656.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance (9.01 m) and lateral distance (10.26 m) show that this obstacle is significantly further away from the ego vehicle, minimizing immediate collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC calculation provides a safe margin. With a longitudinal distance of 9.01 m and the same relative velocity of -0.26 m/s, \( \frac{9.01}{0.26} \approx 34.65 \) seconds indicates no immediate risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 3657.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance (0.84 m) and lateral distance (-5.38 m) indicate a strong risk with the obstacle being very close on the right side. 
  - **Distance safety score**: 2
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC calculated as \( \frac{0.84}{0.26} \approx 3.23 \) seconds indicates manageable but concerning proximity.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 3658.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance (0.24 m) suggests very close proximity to the ego vehicle, warning of imminent collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC calculation gives \( \frac{0.24}{0.26} \approx 0.92 \) seconds, indicating a high probability of collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 1
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 3659.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance (0.32 m) coupled with the proximity in the frontal-left zone suggests a significant risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC calculated as \( \frac{0.32}{0.26} \approx 1.23 \) seconds indicates a concerning likelihood of collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 2
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 3660.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance (12.51 m) and lateral distance (10.23 m) suggest sufficient spacing to rule out immediate collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC calculation provides ample time with \( \frac{12.51}{0.26} \approx 48.12 \) seconds.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 3661.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: With a longitudinal distance of 16.02 m and lateral distance of 10.2 m, the safety risk is negligible.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC is high at \( \frac{16.02}{0.26} \approx 61.92 \) seconds, indicating no collision threat.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
