Safety analysis for the last timestep (6.6 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 6.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 3655.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The ego vehicle is in lanelet 949.0 and obstacle 3655.0 is in lanelet 950.0, which is adjacent but not directly in the lane of travel. The distance in the lateral direction is small due to its proximity (approximately 3.4 meters).
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is stationary (velocity = 0.0), which means that the ego vehicle with a slight velocity (0.2573 m/s) will maintain some distance as it moves forward, reducing immediate concern.
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 3656.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is further away from the ego vehicle (approximately 12.3 meters). It poses no immediate threat due to sufficient distance from the ego trajectory.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** It is stationary and distant, thus no collision risk from a time perspective.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 3657.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The distance is approximately 6.7 meters to the ego vehicle. It is in slight alignment but relatively unthreatening due to its distance.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Like the others, this obstacle is also stationary which means the ego vehicle can safely navigate past it.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 3658.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is only about 1.7 meters away in a very similar orientation but stays out of the direct lane path.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Since the obstacle is stationary, the ego vehicle's ongoing motion at 0.2573 m/s will create a manageable scenario for avoiding interaction.
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 3659.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is approximately 2.8 meters away, similar lanelet, but not directly in line with the travel path.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** No movement from the obstacle indicates low time risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 3660.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Similar to earlier obstacles, it sits around 12.5 meters away and is in an adjacent lanelet; thus, it poses no threat.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Stationary further solidifies the negligible risk factor for collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 3661.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Like obstacle 3660.0, this one also is stationary at over 15 meters, maintaining no risk of interference.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Parallel to the previous observation regarding stationary obstacles.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
``` 

### Conclusion:
All evaluated obstacles show that the ego vehicle can navigate without facing immediate collision risks. There are no observed collisions or extreme risk threats, with most obstacles classified within a low or negligible risk range. The ego vehicle should remain alert but can maneuver safely using current speed dynamics.
