Safety analysis for the last timestep (6.6 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 6.6: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3655.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (950.0) than the ego vehicle (949.0) and poses minimal lateral distance risk.  Longitudinal distance is moderate.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Obstacle is stationary and ego vehicle has a low velocity.  TTC is relatively high.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3656.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (855.0) and poses no risk due to significant lateral separation.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary and poses no time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3657.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (951.0) than the ego vehicle (949.0), posing some lateral distance risk. Longitudinal distance is moderate.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Obstacle is stationary and ego vehicle has low velocity.  TTC is relatively high.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 3658.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet (949.0) as the ego vehicle and relatively close longitudinally.  Requires monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary, and ego vehicle has a low velocity and negative acceleration (braking). TTC is likely safe, but requires close monitoring due to the shared lanelet.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3659.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (948.0) but relatively close laterally. Longitudinal distance is moderate.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary and ego vehicle has low velocity. TTC is relatively high.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3660.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (854.0) and poses no risk due to significant lateral separation.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary and poses no time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3661.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (853.0) and poses no risk due to significant lateral separation.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary and poses no time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
