Safety analysis for the last timestep (6.6 seconds):
I'll analyze the safety situation for the ego vehicle and nearby obstacles.

### Safety Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 3658 (In lanelet 949 - Same as ego vehicle):**
- Distance Risk: Initially at position (435.9093, 7.0288), which is ~5m ahead of ego vehicle on same path. As ego vehicle decelerates, distance remains safe.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk: Vehicle is stationary, ego vehicle decelerates to stop, maintaining safe distance.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

2. **Obstacle 3659 (In lanelet 948 - Adjacent lanelet):**
- Distance Risk: Located at (439.4104, 7.0489), lateral offset provides safe separation.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk: Vehicle becomes stationary, no risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

3. **Obstacle 3655 (In lanelet 950):**
- Distance Risk: Located at (432.4082, 6.9988), sufficient lateral separation.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk: Vehicle is stationary, no collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

4. **Other Obstacles (3656, 3657, 3660, 3661):**
- Located in different lanelets with significant lateral separation
- No direct collision risk
- Overall Risk score: 5

Key Observations:
1. Ego vehicle shows controlled deceleration from ~10.3 m/s to complete stop
2. All obstacles either maintain safe distance or come to stop
3. No immediate collision risks identified
4. Safe trajectory management demonstrated

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Analysis shows no obstacles with collision (score 0) or extreme risk (score 1). The scenario demonstrates safe vehicle behavior with controlled deceleration and appropriate distance management. The ego vehicle successfully navigates to a stop while maintaining safe distances from all obstacles.
