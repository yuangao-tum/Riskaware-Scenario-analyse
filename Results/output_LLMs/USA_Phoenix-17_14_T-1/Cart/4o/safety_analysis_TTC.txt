Safety analysis for the last timestep (6.6 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 6.6: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 3655.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is positioned at (432.4082, 6.9988). The lateral distance from the ego vehicle is approximately 4.78 meters (11.7733 - 6.9988), and the frontal distance is approximately 3.35 meters (435.7614 - 432.4082). Both longitudinal and lateral distances are safe but at the lower end of safety margins.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is static, with zero velocity, reducing the immediate risk of collision. With the ego vehicle moving at 0.2573 m/s, TTC would be approximately 13 seconds for frontal impact if both the ego vehicle and the obstacle maintain speed and trajectory.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

2. **Obstacle ID: 3656.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at (448.0207, -1.3935), this obstacle is approximately 12.26 meters ahead and 13.17 meters laterally away from the ego vehicle. This is considerably safe.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Since the obstacle is static and poses no immediate threat due to its large distance, it is negligible in terms of collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

3. **Obstacle ID: 3657.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is at (428.9334, 6.2286), roughly 6.83 meters behind and 5.54 meters laterally away from the ego vehicle. These distances are satisfactory.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: As the obstacle is stationary and behind the ego vehicle, the time risk is minimal.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

4. **Obstacle ID: 3658.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (435.9093, 7.0288), the obstacle is about 0.15 meters ahead and 4.74 meters laterally from the ego vehicle. This proximity poses some risk, especially longitudinally.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2
   - **Time Risk reason**: With zero velocity, it poses a low to medium immediate risk due to proximity, but manageable given the ego-vehicle's slow speed.
   - **Time safety score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

5. **Obstacle ID: 3659.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at (439.4104, 7.0489), about 3.65 meters ahead and 4.72 meters laterally away, placing it within approachable margins.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3
   - **Time Risk reason**: With the obstacle at rest and considering the TTC, the risk is manageable with current spacing.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

6. **Obstacle ID: 3660.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at (448.0907, -4.8943), approximately 12.33 meters ahead and 16.67 meters laterally away, it is safely distanced from the vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: No immediate collision risk due to its stationary state and significant distance.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

7. **Obstacle ID: 3661.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (448.1608, -8.3989), around 12.40 meters ahead and 20.17 meters laterally, very low risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: No risk due to the ample spacing and stationary state.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5
