Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.5 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario for potential collisions:

### Safety Analysis:

1. Obstacle 20043.0 (Same lanelet 5909 as ego):
- Distance Risk: Very close longitudinal proximity (starts at ~15m, ends at ~11m), same lanelet
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium risk)
- Time Risk: Decreasing velocity but maintaining same lane position
- Time safety score: 4 (Low risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3

2. Obstacle 20046.0 (Same lanelet 5909 as ego):
- Distance Risk: Following behind ego at decreasing speed (~16m distance)
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low risk)
- Time Risk: Decelerating, maintaining safe following distance
- Time safety score: 4 (Low risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4

3. Obstacle 20047.0 (Same lanelet 5909 as ego):
- Distance Risk: Following far behind (~40m)
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible risk)
- Time Risk: No immediate risk due to large distance
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5

4. Obstacle 20045.0 (Crosses path):
- Distance Risk: Crosses ego's potential path at intersection
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium risk)
- Time Risk: Different trajectory with sufficient spacing
- Time safety score: 4 (Low risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3

All other vehicles are either in different lanelets or moving away from the ego vehicle's path, presenting minimal risk.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Key Observations:
1. The ego vehicle is moving at a relatively slow speed (decreasing from 7.5 to 0.9 m/s)
2. Most vehicles maintain safe distances and speeds
3. No immediate collision risks detected
4. The scenario shows proper traffic flow management with adequate spacing between vehicles

While there are vehicles in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, their relative speeds and distances don't indicate any immediate collision risks. The closest attention should be paid to Obstacle 20043.0 due to its proximity, but it maintains a safe distance throughout the sequence.
