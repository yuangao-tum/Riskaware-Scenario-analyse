Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.5 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.5 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

To approach this analysis, I will first calculate the distance and time to collision for each obstacle relevant to the ego vehicle within the same lanelet or trajectory (lanelet 5909.0).

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 20046**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The ego vehicle is at (-12.0074, -16.7281) and the obstacle is at (-11.9202, -20.8629).
     - Longitudinal Distance (x):  | -12.0074 - (-11.9202) | = 0.0872
     - Lateral Distance (y): | -16.7281 - (-20.8629) | = 4.1348
     - DTC = √((0.0872)² + (4.1348)²) = 4.1348 (approximately)
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk - manageable with timely reactions)
   - **Time Risk reason**: 
     - Current speed of the ego vehicle = 0.9577 (approx. 0.958)
     - Speed of the obstacle = 3.9426
     - TTC = DTC / relative speed = 4.1348 / (3.9426 - 0.9577) = 1.25 seconds (approx.)
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk - needs prompt attention)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (combination of distance and time scores)

2. **Obstacle ID: 20047**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: 
     - Obstacle position: (-13.6352, -40.0688).
     - DTC = √((−12.0074 + 13.6352)² + (−16.7281 + 40.0688)²) = 23.2963 (approx.)
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk - minimal collision risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**:
     - Speed of obstacle: 6.0488
     - TTC = DTC / relative speed = 23.2963 / (6.0488 - 0.9577) = 3.73 seconds (approx.)
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 20049**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: 
     - Obstacle position: (-15.5588, -57.7053). 
     - DTC = √((−12.0074 + 15.5588)² + (−16.7281 + 57.7053)²) = 42.3645 (approx.)
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk - minimal collision risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**:
     - Speed of obstacle: 7.7878
     - TTC = DTC / relative speed = 42.3645 / (7.7878 - 0.9577) = 5.56 seconds (approx.)
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

4. **Obstacle ID: 20050**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: 
     - Obstacle position: (-17.393, -74.5219).
     - DTC = √((−12.0074 + 17.393)² + (−16.7281 + 74.5219)²) = 57.2670 (approx.)
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk - minimal collision risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**:
     - Speed of obstacle: 8.4002
     - TTC = DTC / relative speed = 57.2670 / (8.4002 - 0.9577) = 9.05 seconds (approx.)
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

### Overall Conclusion:
- No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk (Overall Risk Score of 0) or extreme risk (Overall Risk Score of 1).
- The obstacles present significant variation in risk levels, with some necessitating immediate attention and others remaining under safe thresholds. The overall highest risk of collision recorded was an Overall Risk Score of 2.
