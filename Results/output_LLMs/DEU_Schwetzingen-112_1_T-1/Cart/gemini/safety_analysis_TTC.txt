Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.5 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.5s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

* **TTC (Time to Collision):**  Calculated separately for longitudinal (TTClong) and lateral (TTClat) directions. A negative TTC indicates the objects are moving away from each other.  TTC is undefined if the relative velocity is zero. We will consider a very large number (e.g., 1000) in such cases for scoring purposes, as it implies no immediate collision risk.
* **MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision):** Approximated using the current positions and assuming constant velocities. More sophisticated models considering acceleration and trajectory curvature could be used for higher fidelity analysis. We will use Euclidean distance for MDC.
* **Overall Risk Score:** Based on the minimum of the longitudinal and lateral TTC and MDC.

**Calculations and Reasoning for each obstacle:**

**Helper functions (Python):**

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_ttc(pos1, vel1, pos2, vel2):
    rel_pos = np.array(pos2) - np.array(pos1)
    rel_vel = np.array(vel2) - np.array(vel1)
    if np.linalg.norm(rel_vel) < 1e-6:
        return 1000  # Large value if relative velocity is almost zero
    ttc = -np.dot(rel_pos, rel_vel) / np.dot(rel_vel, rel_vel)
    return ttc

def calculate_mdc(pos1, pos2):
    return np.linalg.norm(np.array(pos2) - np.array(pos1))

def get_score(ttc, mdc):
    if ttc <= 0 or mdc <= 0: return 0  # collision
    elif ttc <= 1 or mdc <= 1: return 1 # Extreme risk
    elif ttc <= 3 or mdc <= 2: return 2 # High Risk
    elif ttc <= 5 or mdc <= 5: return 3 # Medium risk
    elif ttc <= 10 or mdc <= 10: return 4 # Low risk
    else: return 5

ego_pos = (-12.0074, -16.7281)
ego_vel = (0.9577 * np.cos(1.572884), 0.9577 * np.sin(1.572884)) # decompose velocity into x,y components
