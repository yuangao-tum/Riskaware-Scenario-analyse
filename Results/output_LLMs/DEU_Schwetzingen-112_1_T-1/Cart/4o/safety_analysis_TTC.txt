Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.5 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.5: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 20043.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (14107.0) than the ego vehicle (5909.0) and is relatively far, both laterally and longitudinally.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: With a minimal velocity, this obstacle doesn't pose a threat of reaching the ego vehicle's path imminently.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20045.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is adjacent in the lanelet (5910.0) and moving at a higher velocity, implying a moderate risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's faster velocity needs monitoring, but its trajectory doesn't indicate an immediate collision path.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 20046.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle shares the same lanelet (5909.0) and has a close position with a moderate distance, leading to a marginal collision concern.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative speed and distance suggest the potential for collision if not monitored or maneuvered around.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 20047.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Sharing same lanelet (5909.0), but is positioned significantly behind the ego vehicle, reducing immediate collision risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Moving away due to relative position and velocity indicates low threat over the measured timeframe.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 20048.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located on a different trajectory (lanelet 5086.0) and positioned significantly away.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Its trajectory and speed don't intersect with the ego vehicle in the short term.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20049.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Is significantly behind on the same lanelet (5909.0) and moderately far enough not to threaten collision.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Velocity and position indicate it's not closing distance quickly enough to pose an eminent threat.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 20050.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned far behind on the same lanelet (5909.0), well outside the immediate concern range.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: With the velocity and distance, it is unlikely to interfere with the ego vehicle soon.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Summary in JSON Format: 
All scores above 0 and no conditions for extreme or collision risks indicate no imminent collision threats in this scenario.
