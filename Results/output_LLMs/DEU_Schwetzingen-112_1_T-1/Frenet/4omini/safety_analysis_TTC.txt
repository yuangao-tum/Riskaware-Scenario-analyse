### Safety analysis for timestep 3.5 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 20043.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance is 7.34 m, which indicates the obstacle is relatively close, while the lateral distance of -6.48 m suggests it is also nearby. It is driving toward the ego car longitudinally, increasing the risk.
  - Distance safety score: **2** (High Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocities of -0.16 m/s longitudinally and -1.35 m/s laterally indicate a motion towards the ego vehicle which is likely to lead to a collision in the near future.
  - Time safety score: **2** (High Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **2** (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20045.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance is 0.0 m (indicating an exact alignment) while the lateral distance of 1.85 m means it is very close and moving toward the ego vehicle from the left.
  - Distance safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The longitudinal relative velocity of -13.37 m/s indicates the obstacle is rapidly approaching, heightening the probability of a collision.
  - Time safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **1** (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20046.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal and lateral distances are both 0.0 m, placing the obstacle directly in collision path with the ego car.
  - Distance safety score: **0** (Collision)
  - Time Risk reason: With a longitudinal velocity of 2.98 m/s towards the ego vehicle, this confirms an immediate collision possibility.
  - Time safety score: **0** (Collision)
  - Overall Risk score: **0** (Collision)

- **Obstacle ID: 20047.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance of -18.83 m indicates the obstacle is behind the ego vehicle. The lateral distance of 0.07 m shows a close proximity to the left.
  - Distance safety score: **3** (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity of 5.05 m/s longitudinally means that the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle, likely reducing risk over time.
  - Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **3** (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20048.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: A longitudinal distance of 4.52 m is relatively safe, but a lateral distance of -32.14 m suggests that it's moving away longitudinally and can affect movements in future.
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The longitudinal relative velocity of 1.54 m/s indicates moving away. Lateral velocity of 10.72 m/s suggests it wonâ€™t interfere with the ego vehicle in the immediate future.
  - Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **4** (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20049.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance of -36.46 m and lateral distance of 2.03 m confirms that it is behind the ego vehicle and at a safe distance.
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The longitudinal velocity of 6.78 m/s denotes that it is approaching but due to the distance, the risk remains low.
  - Time safety score: **3** (Medium Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **3** (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20050.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance of -53.27 m and a lateral distance of 3.9 m further indicates a safe distance from the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The longitudinal velocity of 7.39 m/s suggests it is approaching, but the distance still keeps it from being too risky.
  - Time safety score: **3** (Medium Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **3** (Medium Risk)
