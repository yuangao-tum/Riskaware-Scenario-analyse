### Safety analysis for timestep 3.5 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 20043.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is located in the front-right at a longitudinal distance of 7.34m and lateral distance of -6.48m. It is moving towards the ego car longitudinally but moving laterally away.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk: manageable distance but needs attention due to direction towards ego)
  - Time Risk reason: The obstacle has a very low relative longitudinal velocity (-0.16 m/s) indicating a longer time to collision longitudinally, but lateral movement is moving away.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk: more time available to react due to adequate lateral distancing)
  - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20045.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is exactly lateral but very close (1.85m) with a longitudinal distance of 0m indicating potential collision course laterally.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk: immediate lateral proximity)
  - Time Risk reason: The obstacle's relative velocity towards the ego car laterally (-0.26 m/s) indicates a potential collision path relatively quickly.
  - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk: quick action needed due to lateral approach)
  - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20046.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is at both longitudinal and lateral distances of 0m, indicating an immediate collision.
  - Distance safety score: 0 (Collision: no distance remaining)
  - Time Risk reason: With no relative longitudinal distance and very small relative velocity (2.98 m/s), an impact is immediate.
  - Time safety score: 0 (Collision: immediate)
  - Overall Risk score: 0 (Collision)

- **Obstacle ID: 20047.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located rear-left at a longitudinal distance of -18.83m, moving towards the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk: reasonable distance currently, but direction towards needs monitoring)
  - Time Risk reason: Relative velocity (5.05 m/s towards the ego car) suggests moderate time remains to react.
  - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk: manageable with attention)
  - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20048.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the front-right at 4.52m longitudinally and -32.14m laterally, moving laterally towards but longitudinally away.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk: lateral alignment ensures significant distance)
  - Time Risk reason: Its high lateral velocity (10.72 m/s) moving away longitudinally suggests enough time to react.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20049.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Located rear-left at a distance of -36.46m, moving longitudinally towards the ego car.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk: currently safe distance)
  - Time Risk reason: Relative velocity (6.78 m/s) suggests sufficient time remains to observe and react if necessary.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20050.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: This rear-left obstacle is at a distance of -53.27m, moving towards the ego car.
  - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk: large rear distance)
  - Time Risk reason: Relative velocity (7.39 m/s) indicates more than sufficient time to observe changes.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
