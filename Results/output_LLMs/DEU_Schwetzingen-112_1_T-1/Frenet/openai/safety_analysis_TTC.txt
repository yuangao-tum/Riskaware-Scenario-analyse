### Safety analysis for timestep 3.5 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 20043.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is longitudinally 7.34 m and laterally -6.48 m. It poses a manageable distance but is closing in from the front-right. 
   - **Distance safety score**: **4** (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal relative velocity is -0.16 m/s, indicating it is moving closer, but not rapidly. Lateral motion away does not contribute to collision risk. 
   - **Time safety score**: **4** (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: **4**

2. **Obstacle ID: 20045.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance is 0.0 m longitudinally and 1.85 m laterally, indicating an immediate threat as it is laterally aligned with the ego car.
   - **Distance safety score**: **1** (Extreme Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal relative velocity is -13.37 m/s, making a collision imminent.
   - **Time safety score**: **1** (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: **1**

3. **Obstacle ID: 20046.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance is exactly 0.0 m in both longitudinal and lateral directions, indicating direct contact.
   - **Distance safety score**: **0** (Collision)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The vehicle's longitudinal velocity of 2.98 m/s means a collision is occurring.
   - **Time safety score**: **0** (Collision)
   - **Overall Risk score**: **0**

4. **Obstacle ID: 20047.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is -18.83 m (behind) and lateral distance is 0.07 m, indicating a close approach from the rear-left.
   - **Distance safety score**: **2** (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal relative velocity of 5.05 m/s suggests rapidly approaching.
   - **Time safety score**: **2** (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: **2**

5. **Obstacle ID: 20048.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance is 4.52 m longitudinally and -32.14 m laterally, indicating that the obstacle is moving away longitudinally and significantly far away laterally.
   - **Distance safety score**: **5** (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal velocity of 1.54 m/s moving away decreases collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: **5** (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: **5**

6. **Obstacle ID: 20049.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is -36.46 m (behind) and lateral distance is 2.03 m, indicating a less immediate threat.
   - **Distance safety score**: **3** (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal relative velocity of 6.78 m/s indicates a medium approach speed. 
   - **Time safety score**: **3** (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: **3**

7. **Obstacle ID: 20050.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is -53.27 m (behind) and lateral distance is 3.9 m, indicating a significant distance from the ego car.
   - **Distance safety score**: **4** (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal relative velocity of 7.39 m/s indicates fast movement, but its distance mitigates risk. 
   - **Time safety score**: **3** (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: **3**
