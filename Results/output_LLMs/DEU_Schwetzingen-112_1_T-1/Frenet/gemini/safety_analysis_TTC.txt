### Safety analysis for timestep 3.5s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 20043**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 9.1m diagonally front-right of the ego vehicle.  Not an immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving slightly towards the ego longitudinally but away laterally. The slight longitudinal closing velocity doesn't pose an immediate threat given the lateral movement.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20045**
- Distance Risk reason: Very close laterally (1.85m) to the left of the ego vehicle.  Represents a high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Significant negative longitudinal relative velocity (-13.37 m/s) suggests the obstacle and ego vehicle might be on a collision course longitudinally if obstacle is moving forward relative to the ego vehicle's position. Lateral relative velocity is low. Requires immediate attention.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 20046**
- Distance Risk reason:  At the exact location of the ego vehicle (0m longitudinal and lateral distance), indicating a collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason:  Collision has already occurred.  TTC is meaningless in this context.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 20047**
- Distance Risk reason: Located a safe distance (18.83m) behind and slightly to the left of the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle is closing longitudinally, the distance and relative speed are not indicative of imminent danger.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20048**
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively close longitudinally (4.52m) and further away laterally (32.14m) to the front-right.  Lateral distance mitigates some risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, but closing laterally with a high velocity. Requires monitoring due to the lateral movement.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


- **Obstacle ID: 20049**
- Distance Risk reason: Located far behind (36.46m) the ego vehicle. Poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally, but the large distance provides ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20050**
- Distance Risk reason: Located even further behind (53.27m) the ego vehicle. Poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Closing longitudinally, but the very large distance provides ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
