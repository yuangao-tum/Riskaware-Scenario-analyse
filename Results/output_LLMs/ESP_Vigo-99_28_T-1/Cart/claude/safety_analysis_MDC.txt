Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.6 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario for potential collisions:

### Key Observations:
1. Ego vehicle starts in lanelet 466 and moves to lanelet 2230
2. Main obstacles sharing path or adjacent lanelets: 3512, 3513, 3517, 3520, 3521

### Detailed Safety Analysis:

For Obstacle ID: 3512
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moving in adjacent lanelet with increasing lateral separation. Initial MDC ~10m.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity is increasing, reducing collision risk. TTC > 5s
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

For Obstacle ID: 3513
- Distance Risk reason: Initially shares lanelet 466, then moves to different lanelets. MDC ~15m
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving in same direction with similar velocity
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

For Obstacle ID: 3517
- Distance Risk reason: Shares lanelet 466, closest MDC ~15m
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Similar direction and velocity, but maintaining safe distance
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

For Obstacle ID: 3520
- Distance Risk reason: Shares lanelet 466, MDC ~20m
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving in same direction with safe separation
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

For Obstacle ID: 3521
- Distance Risk reason: Shares lanelet 466, MDC ~25m
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Maintaining safe distance and similar velocity
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

No immediate collisions or extreme risks were identified. The ego vehicle maintains safe distances and relative velocities with surrounding vehicles. The most notable interactions are with vehicles sharing lanelet 466, but all maintain safe operational parameters.
