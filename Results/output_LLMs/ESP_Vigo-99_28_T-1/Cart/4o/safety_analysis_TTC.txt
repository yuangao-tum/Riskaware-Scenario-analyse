Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.6 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.6: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3510.0**  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Considering its distance in a different lanelet with a significant gap, not within direct collision path laterally or longitudinally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: The high velocity does not affect ego when considering its lateral displacement.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3511.0**  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in a separate lanelet but relatively close; however, it's stationary.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Minimal velocity, reducing the likelihood of collision in the immediate future.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3512.0**  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Near the ego in distance within the same directional trajectory; however, different lanelet.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity needs monitoring, but reduced immediate danger due to offset lanelet.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3513.0**  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned further from the ego vehicle in another lanelet, not on a collision approach.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: While there's notable velocity, lateral separation prevents immediate risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3515.0**  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary object close by in a different lanelet; hence manageable risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: No current time-pressure to address the stationary obstacle.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3516.0**  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Close, with low speed, manageable but requires awareness.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Low TTC, but mitigation is feasible with awareness.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3517.0**  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Proximity and lane separation make immediate collision unlikely despite speed.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC calculation shows moderate risk, but manageable.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3518.0**  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Nearby but at a different trajectory with minimal forward motion.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity allows manageable response time.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3519.0**  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Notably distant with moderate velocity but traveling a different trajectory.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Decelerating further reduces immediate collision risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3520.0**  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Primarily lateral offset, decreases involvement with the ego.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: While speed is high, the relative direction ensures a negligible immediate risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3521.0**  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Indicates safe lateral and longitudinal separation from the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity without intersecting trajectory.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5
