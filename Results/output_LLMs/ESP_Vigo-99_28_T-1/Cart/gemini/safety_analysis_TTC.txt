Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.6 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories and shapes of vehicles aren't provided, I'll make some simplifying assumptions for this analysis:

* **Point-mass approximation:** Vehicles are treated as points at their center of gravity.
* **Constant acceleration:**  We'll use the provided acceleration values, assuming they remain constant over the short term.  This is a simplification; in reality, accelerations change frequently.
* **Lanelet-based risk:**  Obstacles in different lanelets are initially considered lower risk, unless their positions and velocities suggest a potential lane change or intersection conflict.  The provided context doesn't detail lanelet geometry, so this assessment is approximate.
* **TTC and MDC thresholds:**  Specific TTC and MDC thresholds for each risk level will depend on the ego vehicle's capabilities and safety requirements.  For this example, I'll use illustrative thresholds.  A proper calibration is crucial in a real-world system.
* **Lateral and Longitudinal Analysis**: Separately assessing TTC and MDC in both longitudinal and lateral directions adds more detail and accuracy than simply absolute distance-based estimation. This gives consideration to how velocity differences in either direction between ego and objects contribute to risk.


**Illustrative Thresholds (Adjust based on system requirements):**

* **TTC:**
    * Extreme Risk: < 1 second
    * High Risk: 1-2 seconds
    * Medium Risk: 2-3 seconds
    * Low Risk: 3-5 seconds
    * Negligible Risk: > 5 seconds
* **MDC:**
    * Extreme Risk: < 2 meters
    * High Risk: 2-5 meters
    * Medium Risk: 5-10 meters
    * Low Risk: 10-20 meters
    * Negligible Risk: > 20 meters


### Obstacle Analysis:

It's crucial to remember that the following analysis is based on a single timestep (4.6s).  A comprehensive analysis requires evaluating these metrics over a sequence of timesteps to account for dynamic changes.

Because detailed lane geometry and vehicle dimensions are absent, proper TTC and MDC calculations are impossible. Instead, the provided positions and velocities will be used to provide estimated risk scores. Further consideration is given to lanelets as a proxy for road structure.

- **Obstacle ID: 3510.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet (1315.0) and relatively far from the ego vehicle.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: While in a different lanelet, the obstacle's velocity and position relative to the ego vehicle require monitoring.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3511.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet (268.0) but relatively close laterally to the ego vehicle.  Its low velocity slightly reduces immediate concern.
    - Distance safety score: 3
    - Time Risk reason: The near-zero velocity of this obstacle suggests it might be stationary or nearly so.  The primary risk is from the ego vehicle's movement.
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3512.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet (595.0) and relatively close to the ego vehicle. Its high velocity increases risk.
    - Distance safety score: 2
    - Time Risk reason:  The combination of proximity, different lanelet, and high velocity suggests a possible lane change or intersection conflict.  This requires close monitoring.
    - Time safety score: 2
    - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 3513.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet (1315.0) but its position and moderate velocity warrant attention.
    - Distance safety score: 3
    - Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's moderate velocity and position relative to the ego suggest a potential risk if either vehicle's trajectory changes.
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3515.0**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Located in a different lanelet (268.0) but close laterally to the ego vehicle. Zero velocity reduces immediate risk but still requires monitoring.
    - Distance safety score: 3
    - Time Risk reason:  The stationary nature of the obstacle simplifies the prediction, but its proximity warrants attention.
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3
