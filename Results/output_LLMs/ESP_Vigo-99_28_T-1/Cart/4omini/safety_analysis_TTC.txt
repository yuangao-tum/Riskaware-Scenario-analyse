Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.6 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Step 1: Identify obstacles in the same lanelet or trajectory as the ego vehicle.

The ego vehicle is currently positioned in lanelet 2230.0. Here are the obstacles that are in the same lanelet or trajectory (in lanelets that are connected or influenced by the ego vehicle's lanelet):

1. Obstacle 3511.0 - Position: (61.27, -377.1769) in lanelet 268.0
2. Obstacle 3513.0 - Position: (58.7718, -419.7616) in lanelet 1315.0
3. Obstacle 3515.0 - Position: (63.5087, -384.3391) in lanelet 268.0
4. Obstacle 3516.0 - Position: (57.4088, -361.883) in lanelet 268.0
5. Obstacle 3518.0 - Position: (59.2398, -369.8982) in lanelet 268.0
6. Obstacle 3519.0 - Position: (55.2564, -350.803) in lanelet 268.0
7. Obstacle 3520.0 - Position: (89.738, -389.1643) in lanelet 466.0
8. Obstacle 3521.0 - Position: (103.1355, -383.3544) in lanelet 466.0

#### Step 2: Calculate the metrics for each obstacle.

**Assumptions:**
- The ego vehicle is travelling at a velocity of 6.0682 m/s.
- The obstacles' velocities vary, influencing the potential time to collision (TTC) and minimum distance to collision (MDC).

For simplicity, we will approximate the calculations without calculating the exact angles of approach. We will utilize the Euclidean distance formula and basic kinematic equations to approximate the TTC and MDC.

- **Distance Calculation**: Using the formula 
  \[
  d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
  \]
- **Time to Collision (TTC)**: 
  \[
  TTC = \frac{d}{v} \quad \text{(relative velocity)}
  \]
