### Safety analysis for timestep 4.6: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 3510.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is located at 75.33 m longitudinally and 60.13 m laterally, which is quite a safe distance from the ego vehicle.  
  - **Distance safety score:** 5  
  - **Time Risk reason:** With a relative velocity of 0.62 m/s longitudinally and 6.33 m/s laterally, the time to collision is substantial; thus, immediate collision is not a concern.  
  - **Time safety score:** 5  
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5  

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 3511.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is exactly aligned longitudinally at 0.0 m and is -21.16 m laterally, which indicates it is right beside the ego vehicle.  
  - **Distance safety score:** 2  
  - **Time Risk reason:** The relative longitudinal velocity is -6.07 m/s; the vehicle poses a high risk since it is moving toward the ego car laterally.  
  - **Time safety score:** 2  
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2

- **Obstacle ID:** 3512.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Located 7.87 m longitudinally and -1.17 m laterally, it is approaching the vehicle but still within a close range.  
  - **Distance safety score:** 3  
  - **Time Risk reason:** With a longitudinal relative velocity of 3.43 m/s, the risk of collision increases, but it's manageable with timely reactions.  
  - **Time safety score:** 3  
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3  

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 3513.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is at 17.01 m longitudinally and 12.35 m laterally, indicating it is in a manageable but cautious zone.  
  - **Distance safety score:** 4  
  - **Time Risk reason:** Given that it's driving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally with a relative velocity of -0.53 m/s, while the lateral motion decreases the risk, there’s still a collision risk.  
  - **Time safety score:** 3  
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3  

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 3515.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is aligned at 0.0 m longitudinally and -13.77 m laterally, indicating a close proximity.  
  - **Distance safety score:** 2  
  - **Time Risk reason:** The relative longitudinal velocity of -6.07 m/s indicates a likely approach toward the ego vehicle.  
  - **Time safety score:** 2  
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2  

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 3516.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned at 0.0 m longitudinally and -36.53 m laterally, this also implies an imminent lateral collision.  
  - **Distance safety score:** 2  
  - **Time Risk reason:** With a relative velocity of -5.88 m/s traditionally, this obstacle may likely approach the ego vehicle laterally.  
  - **Time safety score:** 2  
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2  

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 3517.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason:** It's located 0.25 m longitudinally behind, posing a moderate risk concerning rear-end potential.  
  - **Distance safety score:** 3  
  - **Time Risk reason:** The velocity of 1.57 m/s suggests some encroachment on the ego vehicle’s space.  
  - **Time safety score:** 3  
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3  

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 3518.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason:** This is another closely positioned obstacle at 0.0 m longitudinally and -28.57 m laterally.  
  - **Distance safety score:** 2  
  - **Time Risk reason:** The relative lateral approach velocity of -6.06 m/s constitutes a very high risk.  
  - **Time safety score:** 2  
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2  

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 3519.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Close at -2.38 m longitudinally and -47.37 m laterally, represents significant danger in proximity.  
  - **Distance safety score:** 1  
  - **Time Risk reason:** With the -5.16 m/s relative velocity, collision is highly anticipated if not managed immediately.  
  - **Time safety score:** 1  
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1  

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 3520.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Located at -15.51 m longitudinally but at a 0.0 m lateral distance it hints an immediate concern for rear-end collision.  
  - **Distance safety score:** 2  
  - **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocity of 1.58 m/s implies increasing danger if not corrected.  
  - **Time safety score:** 2  
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2  

---

- **Obstacle ID:** 3521.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is at -30.08 m longitudinally and 0.25 m laterally, indicating a high risk from behind.  
  - **Distance safety score:** 2  
  - **Time Risk reason:** As it approaches with a speed of 1.32 m/s, it confirms potential concern for collisions.  
  - **Time safety score:** 2  
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2
