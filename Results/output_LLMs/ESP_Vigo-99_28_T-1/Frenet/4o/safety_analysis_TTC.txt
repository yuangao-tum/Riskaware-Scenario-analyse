### Safety analysis for timestep 4.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 3510**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: With a longitudinal distance of 75.33 m and lateral distance of 60.13 m, the obstacle is not in immediate proximity and is moving away laterally.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Given the obstacle is moving away in both directions, TTC is not immediately concerning.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 3511**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: The longitudinal distance of 0.0 m indicates co-alignment with the ego vehicle, and the lateral distance of -21.16 m shows proximity on the right side.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 3
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Obstacle moving toward the ego car laterally requires prompt attention.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 2
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 2

3. **Obstacle ID: 3512**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: The relatively short longitudinal distance of 7.87 m and lateral distance of -1.17 m suggest proximity at the front-right.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 3
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Despite moving away longitudinally, proper caution is necessary due to proximity.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 3

4. **Obstacle ID: 3513**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: With 17.01 m longitudinally and 12.35 m laterally, the obstacle is fairly close but not immediate.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Moving toward longitudinally but away laterally reduces immediate collision risk.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 3

5. **Obstacle ID: 3515**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Longitudinally aligned with the ego car with a lateral distance of -13.77 m. No lateral movement adds to a higher potential risk.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 3
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Relative alignment with no movement away increases risk.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 3

6. **Obstacle ID: 3516**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Longitudinal distance of 0.0 m and lateral distance of -36.53 m means close alignment but less immediate threat.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Lateral movement towards exacerbates the risk.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 3

7. **Obstacle ID: 3517**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Proximate with a longitudinal distance of -0.25 m, directly behind the ego car.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 2
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Given proximity and direct approach from behind, time to react is crucial.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 2
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 2

8. **Obstacle ID: 3518**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: While longitudinally aligned, lateral distance of -28.57 m indicates comparatively lower risk.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 3
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Lateral movement towards the ego car slightly raises the concern.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 3

9. **Obstacle ID: 3519**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Behind right with 2.38 m longitudinal and -47.37 m lateral distance; moderate risk due to the angle.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Movement away longitudinally slightly lowers immediate risk.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

10. **Obstacle ID: 3520**
    - **Distance Risk Reason**: At -15.51 m longitudinally behind the ego car, poses relatively significant risk due to proximity.
    - **Distance Safety Score**: 3
    - **Time Risk Reason**: Moving towards and close behind requires attention.
    - **Time Safety Score**: 3
    - **Overall Risk Score**: 3

11. **Obstacle ID: 3521**
    - **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned at the rear-left with longitudinal -30.08 m, potential risk, lateral inclination increases risk.
    - **Distance Safety Score**: 3
    - **Time Risk Reason**: Moving towards ego both longitudinally and laterally, but distant enough for reaction.
    - **Time Safety Score**: 3
    - **Overall Risk Score**: 3

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```
All obstacles have an overall risk score greater than 1. None of them indicate an immediate or extreme collision risk. Adjustments to driving strategies and attention are advised, primarily for those near the score of 2.
