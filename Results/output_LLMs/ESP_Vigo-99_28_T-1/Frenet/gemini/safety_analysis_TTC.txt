### Safety analysis for timestep 4.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 3510.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located far away in the Front-left (75.33m longitudinal, 60.13m lateral) and moving away both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No risk of collision due to large distance and diverging motion.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 3511.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located to the Right (-21.16m lateral) with exact longitudinal alignment. Lateral movement towards the ego vehicle presents a risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Requires assessment of the closing lateral speed.  The provided information suggests a risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 3512.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively close in the Front-right (7.87m longitudinal, -1.17m lateral) but moving away both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Diverging motion suggests low risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 3513.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close in the Front-left (17.01m longitudinal, 12.35m lateral). Longitudinal closing motion requires attention.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: While laterally moving away, the longitudinal closing motion needs careful monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 3515.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located to the Right (-13.77m lateral) with exact longitudinal alignment and no lateral relative motion. Moderate risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  The scenario description isn't clear about longitudinal motion, but given the right position and alignment, it poses a risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 3516.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located to the Right (-36.53m lateral) with longitudinal alignment. Lateral motion towards ego poses some risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Lateral movement towards ego needs attention despite the larger lateral distance.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 3517.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Very close behind (-0.25m longitudinal) and almost laterally aligned. High risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinal motion poses a severe threat.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 3518.0**
- Distance Risk reason: To the Right (-28.57m lateral) with longitudinal alignment and slight lateral movement towards ego. Moderate risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Requires assessment due to lateral closing motion, even if slow.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


**- Obstacle ID: 3519.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in the Rear-right (-2.38m longitudinal, -47.37m lateral), moving away longitudinally but towards the ego laterally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Lateral motion towards the ego needs monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 3520.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Behind the ego (-15.51m longitudinal) and longitudinally approaching. Poses a risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Longitudinal closing motion requires attention.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 3521.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in the Rear-left (-30.08m longitudinal, 0.25m lateral) and approaching both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Closing motion in both directions requires attention.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2
