### Safety analysis for timestep 4.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 3510.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 75.33 m and lateral distance is 60.13 m, indicating a safe distance.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Both relative velocity components indicate that the obstacle is moving away. Longitudinal (0.62 m/s) and lateral (6.33 m/s) motions suggest increasing distance.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3511.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 0.0 m; lateral distance is -21.16 m (approaching from the right), indicating it is directly on a collision course.
  - Distance safety score: 1
  - Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal velocity is -6.07 m/s (moving toward) with 0.0 lateral velocity, indicating an immediate collision is imminent.
  - Time safety score: 1
  - Overall Risk score: 1
