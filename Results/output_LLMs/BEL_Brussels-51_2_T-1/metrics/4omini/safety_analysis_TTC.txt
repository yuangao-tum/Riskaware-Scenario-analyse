Safety analysis for timestep 3.9 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30193
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal Distance to Collision (0.99) indicates a moderate risk as the obstacle is relatively close, while Lateral Distance (17.4) provides ample space. Thus, LongDSC is scored as 3 and LatDSC as 4.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 3  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
- Overall Distance Safety Score: DSC = 3 * 0.5 + 4 * 0.5 = 3.5 (rounded down to 3).
- Time Risk Reason: Both Longitudinal and Lateral Time to Collision are infinity, indicating no risk of collision regarding timing. Thus, LongTSC is 5 and LatTSC is 5.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: TSC = 5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5 = 5 (rounded down to 5).
