Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.9 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.9: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30193**
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle is in a different lanelet (1748) than the ego vehicle (1747), but relatively close laterally. The longitudinal distance needs to be considered as well. More information (like lane widths and vehicle dimensions) is needed for accurate assessment.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Similar to the distance risk, the lateral and longitudinal speeds and relative directions are crucial for TTC.  Without more information, the TTC cannot be accurately determined.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30194**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet (84) and appears significantly further away both longitudinally and laterally from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Given its distance and likely different trajectory, the TTC is likely high.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30196**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in lanelet 1746. Positioned very close to the ego vehicle. High risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity and the relative direction suggest a very high probability of imminent collision if the vehicles maintain their current paths.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30197**
- Distance Risk reason: In a different lanelet (1682), but close longitudinally. Lateral distance and relative lane positions are critical factors.  Requires more context to assess accurately.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Similar reasoning as distance risk. The relative velocities and directions determine the TTC.  More information is required for a proper evaluation.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30198**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in lanelet 648. It appears to be further away than obstacle 30197 and poses less immediate risk but still warrants monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The time to collision depends on the relative trajectories and velocities, which require more context.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30199**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located in lanelet 648 and further away than 30198, therefore presenting a lower risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The TTC depends on the relative motion. Given the distances, it is likely higher than for obstacles closer to the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 30200**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in lanelet 648 and even further away than 30199.  Poses less risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Likely a large TTC given its distance.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30201**
- Distance Risk reason: In lanelet 648 and furthest away among the listed obstacles. Poses the least risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: TTC is likely the highest among the listed obstacles.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
