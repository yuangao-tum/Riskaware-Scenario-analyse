Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.9 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.9: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30193**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The minimum distance between Ego and obstacle 30193 is calculated using Euclidean distance. At a position of (261.4999, 42.6839) for Ego and (242.7461, 48.9869) for the obstacle, the distance is approximately 20.85 meters (after calculating the x and y differences).
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk) - A significant distance still exists, but because the obstacle is moving at a higher velocity towards the Ego vehicle, potential impact can occur quickly.
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative speed towards each other (obstacle is faster and coming closer) implies a TTC calculation indicating potential collision within 2-3 seconds.
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk) - Because the obstacle's speed is significantly higher, leading to a likely collision path is imminent.
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk) - Both distance and time metrics indicate a heightened collision risk.

2. **Obstacle ID: 30194**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Ego at (261.4999, 42.6839) and obstacle 30194 at (289.3599, 92.2107) yields an approximate distance of 51.56 meters.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk) - The distance is safe; the risk is manageable, but needs caution.
   - **Time Risk reason**: With the obstacle moving faster predominantly laterally and further away, collision likelihood is minimal within the next seconds.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk) - There's little to no chance of collision, hence the score.
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk).

3. **Obstacle ID: 30196**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance from Ego is approximately 8.72 meters.
   - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk) - Very close proximity creates a high-risk situation.
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is closing in fast; the TTC is about 1 second or less based on relative velocities.
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk) - Immediate collision is on the horizon if reactions aren't swift.
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk) - Immediate actions needed to avoid collision.

4. **Obstacle ID: 30197**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The minimum distance is around 12.55 meters.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk) - Manageable, but vigilance is necessary with the other obstacles around.
   - **Time Risk reason**: High relative velocity placing the vehicle in a potential collision within 3 seconds.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk) - Timely reactions could ensure avoidance.
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk).

5. **Obstacle ID: 30198**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance is approximately 19.8 meters.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk) - Close contact, requiring caution.
   - **Time Risk reason**: Speed and paths suggest potential impact within a few seconds.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk).
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk).

6. **Obstacle ID: 30199**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: At roughly 12.07 meters away.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk) - Closer proximity raises concerns here.
   - **Time Risk reason**: Rapid relative speed indicating collision potential within short time.
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk) - Swift maneuvers might be necessary.
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk).

7. **Obstacle ID: 30200**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Approximately 23.46 meters distance.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk).
   - **Time Risk reason**: Moderate speed interaction suggests collision is not likely soon.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk) - Little to no immediate risk.
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk).

8. **Obstacle ID: 30201**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Distance from Ego around 31.89 meters.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk) - Good separation indicates manageable conditions.
   - **Time Risk reason**: Similar reasoning with slow relative motion.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk).
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk).
