Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.9 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario and evaluate collision risks for the ego vehicle.

Key Observations:
1. The ego vehicle starts in lanelet 1682, moves to 751, then to 1746 and 1747
2. Initial position around (272.8096, 33.7096)
3. Decreasing velocity from ~6.2 to 0.9 m/s
4. Several obstacles in proximity

Detailed Analysis:

1. Obstacle 30196:
- Shares lanelets with ego (1682, 751)
- Closest approach at t=2.0s with distance ~5m
- Time safety score: 4 (Adequate separation time)
- Distance safety score: 3 (Moderate proximity)
- Overall Risk score: 3

2. Obstacle 30193:
- Initially in different lanelet (1746)
- Maintains safe distance >10m
- Time safety score: 5
- Distance safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

3. Obstacle 30194:
- In lanelet 84, perpendicular trajectory
- Large lateral separation
- Time safety score: 5
- Distance safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

4. Obstacles 30197-30201:
- All in lanelet 648
- Maintaining safe distances
- No immediate collision risks
- Overall Risk scores: 4-5

Most Critical Interaction:
- With Obstacle 30196 due to shared lanelet and moderate proximity
- However, relative velocities and deceleration patterns reduce actual collision risk

Summary JSON:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Reasoning:
1. No direct collisions observed (score 0)
2. No extreme risk situations (score 1)
3. Closest interaction (with 30196) maintains sufficient safety margins
4. Ego vehicle's decreasing velocity provides additional safety buffer
5. All other obstacles maintain safe distances and trajectories

The scenario shows good safety margins with no immediate collision risks, though continued monitoring of Obstacle 30196 is recommended.
