Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.9 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.9: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30193.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet and has a significant lateral offset from the ego vehicle.
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: Given its relatively high speed and lateral distance, convergence with the ego vehicle is unlikely.
   - Time safety score: 4
   - Overall Risk score: 4

2. **Obstacle ID: 30194.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is further ahead, with considerable lateral separation, reducing any immediate risk of collision.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: The high speed of the obstacle and substantial lateral separation ensures it is not on a collision course.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

3. **Obstacle ID: 30196.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is nearer in terms of longitudinal distance, requiring attention. However, it's in a different lanelet.
   - Distance safety score: 3
   - Time Risk reason: The speed indicates it may approach the ego vehicle, but the differing lanelet provides separation.
   - Time safety score: 3
   - Overall Risk score: 3

4. **Obstacle ID: 30197.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Substantial lateral offset, reducing collision potential in the immediate future.
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: Its speed indicates parallel movement without convergence.
   - Time safety score: 4
   - Overall Risk score: 4

5. **Obstacle ID: 30198.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Notably distant with lateral offset, minimizing immediate collision risk.
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: High speed and lateral separation suggest no imminent collision path.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 4.5

6. **Obstacle ID: 30199.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Positioned with sufficient lateral separation and far enough to not pose an immediate risk.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity and orientation maintain non-intersecting paths.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

7. **Obstacle ID: 30200.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Significant distance and lane separation suggest minimal immediate threat.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: Its motion path shows no convergence with the ego due to lateral separation.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

8. **Obstacle ID: 30201.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The farthest and laterally offset pose negligible risk to the ego vehicle.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: Its movement trajectory indicates no risk of collision.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

The overall assessment indicates there are no obstacles posing immediate collision threats or classified under extreme risk in this scenario.
