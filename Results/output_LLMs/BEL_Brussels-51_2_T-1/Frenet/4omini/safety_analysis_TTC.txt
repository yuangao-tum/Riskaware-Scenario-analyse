### Safety analysis for timestep 3.9: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30193.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: The longitudinal distance of 0.99 m indicates that it is very close to the ego vehicle. The lateral distance is 17.4 m, which suggests that the obstacle is not in the direct path.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 2 (High Risk) - Close to collision but not in the direct trajectory of the ego vehicle. Needs prompt attention.
  - **Time Risk Reason**: The TTC in the longitudinal direction is about 0.87 seconds, implying an urgent situation. The lateral TTC is not relevant as it's moving away.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 1 (Extreme Risk) - Immediate collision risk based on TTC.
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30194.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: The longitudinal distance is 46.17 m, which is safe, but the lateral distance of -24.1 m suggests it's still in proximity.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk) - Minimal risk, controllable situation.
  - **Time Risk Reason**: The TTC is adequate enough due to the distance.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk) - No significant collision risk for this obstacle.
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30196.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is 0.00 m longitudinally and -0.88 m laterally, indicating it is almost directly beside the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 2 (High Risk) - Close proximity necessitates quick responses.
  - **Time Risk Reason**: The TTC is extremely low; with current relative velocities moving towards the ego car, there is a high likelihood of an immediate collision.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 1 (Extreme Risk) - Critical situation.
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30197.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: The longitudinal distance is -6.21 m indicating that the obstacle is behind the ego car, and -12.75 m laterally poses some risk.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk) - Moderate risk but manageable.
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Checking TTC shows approaching conditions but not immediately critical.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk) - Manageable with adequate reaction time.
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30198.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is -13.01 m longitudinally and -24.54 m laterally, also indicating risk from behind but at a safe enough distance.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk) - Manageable with prior awareness.
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Similar to 30197, the approach is not immediate but should be monitored.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk) - The situation is under control but needs monitoring.
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30199.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: The longitudinal distance of -18.2 m and lateral distance of -37.32 m suggest it is getting closer but remains safely away in the lane.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk) - Minimal risk situation.
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Similar to previous, the time to impact is further out.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk) - Good control over the situation.
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30200.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Longitudinal distance of -23.28 m and lateral distance -49.88 m show a distant obstacle.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk) - Far enough, manageably away.
  - **Time Risk Reason**: The time to collision is also sufficiently delayed.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk) - No collision risk perceived.
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30201.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Longitudinal distance of -27.98 m and lateral distance -61.85 m indicates not a threat due to adequate distance.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk) - No significant danger from this obstacle.
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Similarly the time to there's plenty of time.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk) - An uncritical situation.
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
