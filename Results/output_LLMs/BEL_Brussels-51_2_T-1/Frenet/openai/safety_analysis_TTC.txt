### Safety analysis for timestep 3.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30193.0
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance is 0.99 m, which is very close, and the lateral distance is 17.4 m. The obstacle is relatively moving away, reducing distance risk.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk) - close to collision, requires quick attention.
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal relative velocity of 1.13 m/s gives a TTC of 0.99 m/1.13 m/s = 0.875 seconds. Lateral motion (relative lateral speed of 4.51 m/s) enables lateral avoidance but is not directly relevant here.
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk) - immediate collision likelihood.
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30194.0
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance is 46.17 m (safe), and the lateral distance is -24.1 m (obstacle moving away).
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk) - controllable with sufficient time to react.
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal velocity of 6.18 m/s gives a TTC of 46.17 m/6.18 m/s = 7.45 seconds, indicating no immediate risk.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk) - no significant collision risk.
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30196.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 0.0 m (immediate collision) and lateral distance is -0.88 m (approaching directly from the right).
  - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk) - immediate collision.
  - Time Risk reason: Zero longitudinal distance indicates immediate collision impending; thus, TTC is undefined (collision imminent).
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk) - immediate collision likelihood.
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30197.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is -6.21 m and lateral distance is -12.75 m, meaning it is already behind and to the right of the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk) - close to collision.
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal speed of 3.52 m/s, TTC is negative (indicates ongoing threat).
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk) - ongoing risk of collision.
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30198.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is -13.01 m and lateral distance is -24.54 m, behind the ego vehicle but still approaching.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk) - close to collision.
  - Time Risk reason: Negative TTC indicating imminent collision.
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk) - ongoing risk of collision.
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30199.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is -18.2 m and lateral distance is -37.32 m, a rear-right position still approaching.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk) - close to collision.
  - Time Risk reason: Negative TTC indicating imminent collision.
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk) - ongoing risk of collision.
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30200.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is -23.28 m and lateral distance is -49.88 m, still behind the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk) - close to collision.
  - Time Risk reason: Negative TTC indicating imminent collision.
  - Time safety score:
