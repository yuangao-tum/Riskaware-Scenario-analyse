### Safety analysis for timestep 3.9: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30193.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is 0.99 m ahead on the longitudinal axis and 17.4 m to the left laterally, moving away from the ego car.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** With the obstacle moving away longitudinally (relative velocity of 1.13 m/s) and laterally (4.51 m/s), the potential risk decreases over time.
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30194.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned at a considerable distance of 46.17 m longitudinally and 24.1 m laterally, moving away.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is moving away both longitudinally and laterally, indicating very low time risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30196.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is very close at 0.0 m longitudinally and 0.88 m laterally to the right, moving toward the ego car.
  - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Close proximity with a lateral velocity toward the ego vehicle indicates an immediate potential collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30197.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is 6.21 m behind longitudinally (negative value indicates rear) and 12.75 m laterally, moving toward the ego car.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Given its notable approach speed, caution is advised, though there is enough time to react.
  - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30198.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Located 13.01 m behind longitudinally and 24.54 m laterally, approaching quickly.
  - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is closing in from behind at sufficient speed to warrant a quick response.
  - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30199.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned 18.2 m behind longitudinally and 37.32 m laterally, with moderate approach speed.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The motion considering current distances indicates moderate time to react, yet constant awareness is necessary.
  - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30200.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Further away at 23.28 m behind longitudinally and 49.88 m laterally.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Is approaching very slowly, allowing ample reaction time.
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30201.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** At 27.98 m behind longitudinally and 61.85 m laterally, moving marginally toward the ego car.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Similar to the previous obstacle, very slow approach gives plenty of safe reaction time.
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)
