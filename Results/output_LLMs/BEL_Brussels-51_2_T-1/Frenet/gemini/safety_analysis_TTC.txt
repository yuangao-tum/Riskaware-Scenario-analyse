### Safety analysis for timestep 3.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30193.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far away laterally (17.4m) and slightly ahead longitudinally (0.99m) but moving away. Front-Left location poses minimal risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally.  Lateral movement is not a concern given the large distance.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30194.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far away both longitudinally (46.17m) and laterally (24.1m) and moving away. Front-Right location poses no risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away in both directions.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID:** 30196.0
- Distance Risk reason: Laterally very close (-0.88m) to the ego vehicle on the right side and at the same longitudinal position. This presents a high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Lateral velocity indicates the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle, increasing the risk. Longitudinal velocity suggests parallel movement, but the lateral movement is the primary concern.  TTC calculation would be complex given the near-zero longitudinal distance, but unnecessary given the clear and present danger.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID:** 30197.0
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively close behind (-6.21m) and to the right (-12.75m) and moving closer. Rear-Right location poses a moderate risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Closing in both longitudinally and laterally, requiring monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 30198.0
- Distance Risk reason: Further behind (-13.01m) and to the right (-24.54m) than 30197.0 but still moving closer.  Poses a lower risk than 30197.0.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Similar to 30197.0, closing in both directions, but the greater distance provides more time to react.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 30199.0
- Distance Risk reason: Even further behind (-18.2m) and to the right (-37.32m) than 30198.0. The increasing distances reduce the risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Similar movement as 30197.0 and 30198.0, but the larger distances lower the time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID:** 30200.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Continuing the trend of increasing longitudinal (-23.28m) and lateral (-49.88m) distances, lowering the risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Similar to 30199.0.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30201.0
- Distance Risk reason: Furthest away both longitudinally (-27.98m) and laterally (-61.85m).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Similar closing behavior, but the large distances mitigate the risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
