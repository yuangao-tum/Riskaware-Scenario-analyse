Safety analysis for the last timestep (7.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 7.7 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 30694.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The distance to the obstacle is approximately √((418.4198 - 406.0761)² + (-118.7659 + 81.4489)²) = √(increased distance) which indicates it is in close proximity to the ego.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk - Close to collision)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity between the ego vehicle (5.7321) and obstacle (8.7956) is 8.7956 - 5.7321 ≈ 3.0635. Calculating the TTC: \( \text{TTC} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Closing Speed}} = \frac{7.34}{3.0635} \approx 2.4 \) seconds.
  - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk - Needs prompt attention)
  - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30695.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The distance to this obstacle is also relatively close at approximately 40.0 units.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk - Manageable with timely reactions)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative speed again increases the urgency of a potential collision. Using similar calculations, the relative velocities indicate quicker interaction and higher likelihood of collision convergence.
  - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk - Quick manoeuvring needed)
  - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30698.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is stationary at (383.2946, -39.6729); thus, the immediate distance is still notable but not critical.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk - Minimal risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Being stationary results in a TTC of undefined as there’s no motion towards; however, it doesn’t pose an imminent collision risk.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk - No risk of collision)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30700.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The position estimates indicate that this vehicle is traveling similarly in lanelet 596, making close proximity significant.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk - Manageable with timely reactions)
  - Time Risk reason: The observed speed relative to the ego indicates a TTC that shows moderate interactions on the same trajectory.
  - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk - Manageable but needs awareness)
  - Overall Risk score: 3

### Summary of Findings:
- Overall, all obstacles except the stationary one present various degrees of risk.
- The highest risks come from obstacles 30694.0 and 30695.0, which are in trajectory close to the ego vehicle, requiring immediate attention to avoid potential conflicts.
- Obstacle 30698.0, while not in a risk of collision, remains a consideration due to its stationary nature. 
- Obstacle 30700.0 presents moderate risk, indicating that while it is not immediately critical, ongoing awareness is paramount.
- No collisions or extreme risk obstacles were identified from this analysis.
