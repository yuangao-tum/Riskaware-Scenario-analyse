Safety analysis for the last timestep (7.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 7.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

The evaluation considers lanelets, orientation, velocity, and position to determine the risk assessment accurately.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30694
- **Distance Risk reason:** 
  - The obstacle is not in the same lanelet and is located at a considerable distance from the ego vehicle.
  - Calculating the Euclidean distance between the ego position and the obstacle's position suggests a significant separation, indicating low risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** 
  - Even though the obstacle's velocity is high, its trajectory suggests movement away from the ego vehicle's path, reducing collision risk.
  - Time to collision calculations considering relative velocity and distance would provide a comfortable lead time, indicating low risk.
- **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30695
- **Distance Risk reason:** 
  - This obstacle is neither in the same lanelet nor in a converging trajectory.
  - The distance is substantial due to different orientations and lanelet paths, implying the risk is minimal.
- **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** 
  - With a higher velocity and different orientation, the obstacle moves on a non-converging trajectory away from the ego vehicle.
  - Time to collision metrics further support a negligible risk in terms of time.
- **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30698
- **Distance Risk reason:** 
  - The obstacle is stationary and significantly distant due to its different lanelet and position.
  - The stasis and separation contribute to the minimal collision risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** 
  - As the obstacle is stationary, there is no direct threat of collision from movement.
  - Other factors, such as current trajectory, support that there is no immediate collision course.
- **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30700
- **Distance Risk reason:** 
  - This obstacle is situated in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, suggesting a closer proximity evaluation.
  - The lateral distance in conjunction with similar orientations demands attention, but the physical positioning indicates a low risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** 
  - With similar orientation and notable speed lower than 30694 and 30695, there's a temporal factor, but efficiency in velocity management and strategic lane adaptation ease this.
  - The obstacle is ahead but moving at a manageable velocity, thus decreasing immediate collision risk.
- **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
No obstacles are trending towards immediate collision risk with score 0 or extreme risk with score 1.

This evaluation shows that the ego vehicle can maintain safe passage by adjusting its speed and being aware of its surroundings, particularly vehicle 30700 sharing the same lanelet.
