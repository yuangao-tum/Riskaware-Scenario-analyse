Safety analysis for the last timestep (7.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 7.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30694.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located in a different lanelet (931) than the ego vehicle (596), suggesting a lateral separation.  Further calculations are needed to precisely determine lateral distance and risk, but the different lanelets suggest some inherent safety margin. Longitudinal distance needs calculation based on provided coordinates.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk -  Assumption based on lanelet information.  Actual risk depends on the road geometry and lanelet configurations)
- Time Risk reason: Requires TTC calculation based on relative velocities and positions. Different lanelets might imply no immediate collision risk, but again depends on road geometry and future trajectories.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk - Assumption based on lanelet information. Actual risk depends on future trajectories and maneuvers).
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30695.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is located in a different lanelet (117) than the ego vehicle (596). Similar to the previous obstacle, this suggests lateral separation and a lower risk, but the real risk depends on the road geometry. Longitudinal distance requires calculation.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk - Assumption based on lanelet information)
- Time Risk reason: TTC calculation is needed.  Different lanelets suggest lower risk, but it depends on future trajectories.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk - Assumption based on lanelet information)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 30698.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (223) and is stationary (velocity 0). Longitudinal and lateral distances need calculation based on the coordinates to assess the actual proximity.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk - Stationary obstacle but proximity is unclear without distance calculation)
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary, so TTC in the longitudinal direction might be high if the ego vehicle is moving away.  Lateral TTC depends on the ego vehicle's lateral movement. Proper distance calculations are essential.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk - Stationary obstacle requires careful distance assessment)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 30700.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the SAME lanelet (596) as the ego vehicle. This raises a significant concern. Longitudinal distance and closing velocity are critical to determine the TTC and the risk level.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk - Same lanelet necessitates careful analysis of longitudinal distance)
- Time Risk reason: Both vehicles are moving.  TTC is crucial here.  A small TTC in the same lanelet indicates a high risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk - Same lanelet and moving vehicles require accurate TTC)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

 **Important Considerations:**

* **Missing Calculations:** This analysis lacks concrete distance and TTC calculations, which are essential for accurate risk assessment.  The provided coordinates and velocities should be used to calculate precise distances (both longitudinal and lateral) and TTC values.
* **Lanelet Information:** While lanelet information provides some insights into potential risk, the actual road geometry, lane widths, and potential lane changes are crucial factors that are not fully accounted for here.
* **Future Trajectory Prediction:**  Predicting the future trajectories of both the ego vehicle and obstacles is vital for a comprehensive collision analysis. This involves considering intended maneuvers, such as lane changes or braking.



Without the specific calculations mentioned above, the provided scores are initial estimations based on lanelet information and general assumptions.  A more rigorous mathematical analysis is needed for a definitive risk assessment.
