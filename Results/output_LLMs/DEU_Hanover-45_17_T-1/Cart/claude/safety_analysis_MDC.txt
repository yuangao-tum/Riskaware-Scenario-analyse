Safety analysis for the last timestep (7.7 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario for collision risks between the ego vehicle and surrounding obstacles.

### Safety Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30699 (Initial Timesteps)**:
- Distance Risk: High risk at initial timesteps due to close lateral distance in lanelet 1916 and similar trajectory path
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk: Medium risk due to converging paths and velocity difference
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 2

2. **Obstacle 30700**:
- Distance Risk: Medium risk as it's in the same lanelet (1040) initially
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk: Low risk due to sufficient following distance
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

3. **Obstacle 30694**:
- Distance Risk: Low risk as it maintains safe distance throughout
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk: Low risk due to stable trajectory
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

4. **Other Obstacles (30695, 30696, 30698)**:
- Distance Risk: Low to negligible risk due to different lanelets and sufficient spacing
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk: Low risk due to different trajectories
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

Key observations:
- No direct collisions observed
- Closest interaction is with Obstacle 30699 in early timesteps
- Safe distances maintained throughout the scenario
- Most obstacles follow predictable trajectories

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

This scenario shows no immediate collision risks (score 0) or extreme risks (score 1). The lowest risk score observed is 2, indicating high but manageable risk levels with Obstacle 30699 during initial timesteps. All other interactions maintain safer distances and relative velocities.
