### Safety analysis for timestep 7.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30694.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is in front and moving away longitudinally (34.8m) with slight lateral movement (0.0m).  No immediate risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** Moving away longitudinally, increasing TTC. Lateral velocity is minimal, not a significant concern.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30695.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is to the front-right (28.56m longitudinal, -53.01m lateral) and moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally, but away laterally.  Lateral distance is significant.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:**  Closing longitudinally (-12.44 m/s), requires monitoring. Lateral motion is diverging, reducing risk.
- **Time safety score:** 3
- **Overall Risk score:** 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 30698.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is behind and to the right (-42.33m longitudinal, -6.76m lateral) and moving away longitudinally. No immediate risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** Moving away longitudinally, increasing TTC.  No lateral relative motion.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID:** 30700.0
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Obstacle is very close behind (-0.07m longitudinal, 0.0m lateral), representing a high risk of collision.
- **Distance safety score:** 1
- **Time Risk reason:**  Closing longitudinally (2.58 m/s), imminent collision risk.
- **Time safety score:** 1
- **Overall Risk score:** 1
