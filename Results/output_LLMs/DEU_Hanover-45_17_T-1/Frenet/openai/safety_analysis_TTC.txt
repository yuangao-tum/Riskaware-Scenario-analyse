### Safety analysis for timestep 7.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID**: 30694.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is at a longitudinal distance of 34.8 m and lateral distance of 0.0 m, indicating clear front alignment. Since it is moving away longitudinally, the risk of collision decreases.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: With a relative longitudinal velocity of 3.04 m/s and a clear path, the TTC is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{TTC}_{long} = \frac{\text{DTClong}}{\text{Vrel\_long}} = \frac{34.8 \text{ m}}{3.04 \text{ m/s}} = 11.43 \text{ s}
     \]
     Since there's enough time to react, score is high.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4  

2. **Obstacle ID**: 30695.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is 28.56 m longitudinally and -53.01 m laterally. The negative lateral distance indicates it is significantly to the right. However, the longitudinal position is concerning as it drives toward the ego car.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative longitudinal velocity of -12.44 m/s indicates a closure rate, thus:
     \[
     \text{TTC}_{long} = \frac{\text{DTClong}}{-\text{Vrel\_long}} = \frac{28.56 \text{ m}}{|-12.44| \text{ m/s}} = 2.30 \text{ s}
     \]
     which is very close, indicating immediate concern.
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1  

3. **Obstacle ID**: 30698.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is longitudinally at -42.33 m (behind the ego vehicle) and 6.76 m laterally. Since itâ€™s moving away longitudinally, this does not pose a significant risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity being -5.73 m/s gives:
     \[
     \text{TTC}_{long} = \frac{-42.33 \text{ m}}{-5.73 \text{ m/s}} = 7.40 \text{ s}
     \]
     indicating ample time to react.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4  

4. **Obstacle ID**: 30700.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is longitudinally at -0.07 m and laterally at 0.0 m, indicating it is almost directly behind the ego vehicle and moving toward it. This is a critical situation.
   - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: With a relative velocity longitudinally of 2.58 m/s:
     \[
     \text{TTC}_{long} = \frac{0.07 \text{ m}}{2.58 \text{ m/s}} \approx 0.027 \text{ s}
     \]
     indicating immediate collision is unavoidable.
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1
