### Safety analysis for timestep 7.7 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID**: 30694.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is 34.8 m in front of the ego car with no lateral offset (0.0 m). It is moving away longitudinally. Therefore, the distance is considered safe as it’s a good distance away.
   - **Distance safety score**: **4** (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity longitudinally is 3.04 m/s. The TTC can be calculated as:
     \[
     TTC = \frac{D_{TClong}}{V_{rel\_long}} = \frac{34.8 \text{ m}}{3.04 \text{ m/s}} \approx 11.43 \text{ seconds}
     \]
     This suggests that there is substantial time before a potential collision could occur, indicating safety.
   - **Time safety score**: **5** (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: **4**

2. **Obstacle ID**: 30695.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance to the obstacle is 28.56 m longitudinally and -53.01 m laterally (front-right). The longitudinal distance indicates potential proximity, as the obstacle is moving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally.
   - **Distance safety score**: **3** (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity longitudinally is -12.44 m/s, suggesting it’s approaching rapidly. The TTC for longitudinal is:
     \[
     TTC = \frac{D_{TClong}}{|V_{rel\_long}|} = \frac{28.56 \text{ m}}{|-12.44| \text{ m/s}} \approx 2.30 \text{ seconds}
     \]
     Since the TTC is low and the vehicle is approaching quickly, this indicates a significant risk.
   - **Time safety score**: **2** (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: **2**

3. **Obstacle ID**: 30698.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is 42.33 m behind and slightly to the right (lateral -6.76 m). It is moving away longitudinally, so this position presents a low collision risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: **4** (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity longitudinally is -5.73 m/s. With no concern for lateral collision, the TTC is:
     \[
     TTC = \frac{-D_{TClong}}{|V_{rel\_long}|} = \frac{42.33 \text{ m}}{|-5.73| \text{ m/s}} \approx 7.40 \text{ seconds}
     \]
     This indicates low risk in terms of time also.
   - **Time safety score**: **5** (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: **4**

4. **Obstacle ID**: 30700.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The collision risk from this obstacle is concerning as it is almost right behind the ego car at just 0.07 m away. This is extremely close and warrants immediate concern.
   - **Distance safety score**: **1** (Extreme Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The longitudinal relative velocity is 2.58 m/s with a direct approach:
     \[
     TTC = \frac{-D_{TClong}}{|V_{rel\_long}|} = \frac{0.07 \text{ m}}{2.58 \text{ m/s}} \approx 0.027 \text{ seconds}
     \]
     This indicates an immediate and critical risk of collision.
   - **Time safety score**: **1** (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: **1**

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30700.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30700.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

### Conclusion:
The analysis reveals that the most immediate concern is Obstacle 30700.0, which poses a collision risk with an extreme risk score of 1. Additionally, Obstacle 30695.0 is also a notable risk with a high risk score of 2, whereas the remaining obstacles have low to negligible risks.
