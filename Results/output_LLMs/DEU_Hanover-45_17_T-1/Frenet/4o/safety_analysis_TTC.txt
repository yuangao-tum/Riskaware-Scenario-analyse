### Safety analysis for timestep 7.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30694.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is directly in front of the ego car with a longitudinal distance of 34.8 m and no lateral offset (lateral distance is 0.0 m). It is moving away longitudinally.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Since the obstacle is moving away longitudinally with a relative velocity of 3.04 m/s, the risk of collision is decreasing, leading to a relatively safe time to collision scenario.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30695.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in the front-right at 28.56 m longitudinally and -53.01 m laterally, indicating it is far laterally and moving away to the right.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Though moving towards the ego car longitudinally at -12.44 m/s, the lateral distance ensures safety, as the lateral movement is away from the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30698.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in the rear-right at -42.33 m longitudinally and -6.76 m laterally. The obstacle is moving away longitudinally, creating ample space.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: There is negligible relative velocity longitudinally and no lateral motion. The obstacle is moving away, indicating no risk of collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30700.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located directly behind the ego vehicle at -0.07 m longitudinally with exact lateral alignment (0.0 m). It presents a significant risk as it's very close.
- **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving towards the ego car at 2.58 m/s. The small distance provides very little time to react to prevent a collision.
- **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
