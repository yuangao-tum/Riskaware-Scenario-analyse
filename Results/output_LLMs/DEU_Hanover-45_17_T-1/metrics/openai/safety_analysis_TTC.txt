Safety analysis for timestep 7.7 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 7.7 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30694
- **Relative Direction:** Front
- **Distance Risk Reason:** The longitudinal distance to collision is 34.8 (safe), but the lateral distance is 0.0, indicating a direct alignment. Longitudinally, the obstacle is moving away, so there is no immediate concern.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 0
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** DSC = 5 * 1 + 0 * 0 = 5
- **Time Risk Reason:** Longitudinal time to collision is infinite (safe), but the lateral time is 0.0, indicating an immediate risk of collision.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 5
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 0
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** TSC = 5 * 1 + 0 * 0 = 5
- **Overall Risk Score:** Risk Score = 0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 5 = 5 → rounded down to 5

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30695
- **Relative Direction:** Front-right
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Longitudinally, there is an 28.56 distance to collision (safe), but laterally, there is 53.01, indicating the obstacle is at a safe distance on the right.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 3  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 4
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** DSC = 3 * 0.5 + 4 * 0.5 = 3.5 → rounded down to 3
- **Time Risk Reason:** The longitudinal time to collision is 2.3 (high risk), while the lateral time is infinite (safe). Thus, risk is from the front.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 2
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 5
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** TSC = 2 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5 = 3.5 → rounded down to 3
- **Overall Risk Score:** Risk Score = 0.5 * 3 + 0.5 * 3 = 3.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30698
- **Relative Direction:** Rear-right
- **Distance Risk Reason:** The longitudinal distance is 42.33 (safe) while the lateral distance is 6.76 (also safe).
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 4
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** DSC = 5 * 0.5 + 4 * 0.5 = 4.5 → rounded down to 4
- **Time Risk Reason:** Both longitudinal and lateral times to collision are infinite (safe).
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 5
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 5
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** TSC = 5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5 = 5
- **Overall Risk Score:** Risk Score = 0.5 * 4 + 0.5 * 5 = 4.5 → rounded down to 4.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30700
- **Relative Direction:** Behind
- **Distance Risk Reason:** The longitudinal distance is 0.07 (very close) and lateral distance is 0.0 (aligned), indicating a critical immediate collision scenario.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 0  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 0
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** DSC = 0 * 1 + 0 * 0 = 0
- **Time Risk Reason:** Longitudinal time to collision is 0.03 (very close), while lateral time is 0.0 (immediate risk).
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 0
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 0
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** TSC = 0 * 1 + 0 * 0 = 0
- **Overall Risk Score:** Risk Score = 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 0 = 0.
