Safety analysis for timestep 7.7 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 7.7 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30694
- Relative Direction: Front
- Distance Risk Reason: The longitudinal distance to the obstacle is 34.8 meters, which is safe. However, the lateral distance is 0.0 meters, indicating the ego vehicle is in direct alignment with the obstacle. This presents an extreme risk.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 1
- Overall Distance Safety Score: DSC = 5 * 1 + 1 * (1 - 1) = 5 + 0 = 5
- Time Risk Reason: The longitudinal time to collision is infinite, meaning there is no imminent threat from this obstacle, while the lateral time to collision of 0.0 seconds indicates collision is a certainty if the vehicle does not move. This yields an extreme risk.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 1
- Overall Time Safety Score: TSC = 5 * 1 + 1 * (1 - 1) = 5 + 0 = 5
- Overall Risk Score: Risk Score = 0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 5 = 5

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30695
- Relative Direction: Front-right
- Distance Risk Reason: The longitudinal distance to the obstacle is 28.56 meters, which is safe, while the lateral distance is 53.01 meters, indicating a safe distance on the right. However, the longitudinal movement of the obstacle toward the ego vehicle is concerning. This yields a medium risk.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 3  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: DSC = 3 * 1 + 5 * (1 - 1) = 3 + 0 = 3
- Time Risk Reason: The longitudinal time to collision is 2.3 seconds, indicating a fairly urgent situation, while the lateral time to collision is infinite, showing no immediate lateral threat. This also yields a medium risk.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 2
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: TSC = 2 * 1 + 5 * (1 - 1) = 2 + 0 = 2
- Overall Risk Score: Risk Score = 0.5 * 3 + 0.5 * 2 = 2.5 (rounded to 3)

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30698
- Relative Direction: Rear-right
- Distance Risk Reason: The longitudinal distance to this obstacle is 42.33 meters, which is safe, and the lateral distance is 6.76 meters indicating some proximity. However, since the obstacle is moving away, this presents negligible risk.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
- Overall Distance Safety Score: DSC = 5 * 0.5 + 4 * (1 - 0.5) = 2.5 + 2 = 4.5 (rounded to 5)
- Time Risk Reason: Both the longitudinal and lateral times to collision are infinite, showing no immediate threat from this obstacle.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: TSC = 5 * 0.5 + 5 * (1 - 0.5) = 2.5 + 2.5 = 5
- Overall Risk Score: Risk Score = 0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 5 = 5

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30700
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: The longitudinal distance to this obstacle is 0.07 meters, indicating the vehicle is almost in direct contact with it. The lateral distance is 0.0 meters, confirming direct alignment. This represents a collision risk.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 1
- Overall Distance Safety Score: DSC = 1 * 1 + 1 * (1 - 1) = 1 + 0 = 1
- Time Risk Reason: The longitudinal time to collision is 0.03 seconds, indicating an immediate threat, while the lateral time to collision is 0.0 seconds, indicating a collision is assured. This situation presents a collision risk.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: TSC = 1 * 1 + 0 * (1 - 1) = 1 + 0 = 1
- Overall Risk Score: Risk Score = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 1 = 1
