Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.7 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario for collision risks:

1. First, identifying vehicles in the same lanelet (1208) as the ego vehicle:
- Obstacle 20043 (stationary)
- Obstacle 20045 (stationary)
- Obstacle 20048 (moving)
- Obstacle 20051 (moving)

2. Detailed Safety Analysis:

For Obstacle 20048:
- Distance Risk Reason: Located ahead in same lanelet, distance ~15m, reducing speed
- Distance Safety Score: 4 (Low risk due to sufficient spacing)
- Time Risk Reason: Very slow moving (< 1 m/s at end), increasing distance
- Time Safety Score: 4 (Low risk due to diverging trajectories)
- Overall Risk Score: 4

For Obstacle 20051:
- Distance Risk Reason: Behind ego vehicle, ~25m separation, decreasing speed
- Distance Safety Score: 4 (Low risk due to sufficient spacing)
- Time Risk Reason: Speed differential decreasing, maintaining safe distance
- Time Safety Score: 4 (Low risk)
- Overall Risk Score: 4

For Obstacle 20043 (Stationary):
- Distance Risk Reason: Stationary, well ahead, >20m separation
- Distance Safety Score: 5 (Negligible risk)
- Time Risk Reason: No relative motion
- Time Safety Score: 5 (Negligible risk)
- Overall Risk Score: 5

For Obstacle 20045 (Stationary):
- Distance Risk Reason: Stationary, well ahead, >15m separation
- Distance Safety Score: 5 (Negligible risk)
- Time Risk Reason: No relative motion
- Time Safety Score: 5 (Negligible risk)
- Overall Risk Score: 5

Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Key Findings:
1. No immediate collision risks identified
2. All vehicles maintaining safe distances
3. Ego vehicle is traveling at decreasing speed (from ~10 m/s to ~1.1 m/s)
4. Stationary obstacles pose no immediate threat
5. Moving vehicles in same lanelet have safe separation distances and decreasing relative velocities
