Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories and shapes are not provided, I make simplifying assumptions for this analysis.  I consider primarily relative positions, velocities, and headings to estimate risk. A more robust analysis would require detailed trajectory prediction and inter-vehicle distance calculations accounting for vehicle dimensions.  I'll use a  basic "bounding circle" approach for estimating MDC, assuming a nominal safety radius around each vehicle.

**Calculations:** Simplified TTC and MDC approximations are made based on relative velocity and position differences. For static obstacles, TTC is considered infinite if the ego vehicle is moving away.

**- Obstacle ID: 20038.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is relatively far and in a different lanelet (1210.0 vs. ego's 1208.0).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  While moving faster than the ego vehicle, its trajectory is unlikely to intersect in the short term.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 20039.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively close and potentially in the ego vehicle's path depending on future maneuvers.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Static, so no immediate time-based risk if the ego vehicle steers clear.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 20040.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Close, and potentially in the path.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Static, risk depends on ego's actions.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


**- Obstacle ID: 20041.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Close, and potentially in the path.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Static, risk depends on ego's actions.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3


**- Obstacle ID: 20042.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Close, and potentially in the path.
- Distance safety score: 3

- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 20043.0**
- Distance Risk reason: In the same lane and relatively close.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Static obstacle directly ahead.  Requires ego vehicle to brake or steer.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 20044.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively close.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Static.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3


**- Obstacle ID: 20045.0**
- Distance Risk reason: In the same lane and close.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Static. Requires ego vehicle action.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 20046.0, 20047.0, 20050.0, 20053.0**: Similar analysis to the other obstacles in lanelet 2219.0. Moderately far, static, posing a low to medium risk dependent on the ego vehicle's future trajectory. Score 3-4.

**- Obstacle ID: 20048.0**
- Distance Risk reason: In the same lane and close.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Static.  Requires ego vehicle action.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 20051.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  In the same lane and relatively close behind.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving slower than the ego vehicle; risk of collision if ego decelerates rapidly.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


**- Obstacle ID: 20052.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  In the same lane, further behind than 20051.0.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving slower than ego, but not immediately concerning.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
