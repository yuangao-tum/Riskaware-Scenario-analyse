Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 20038.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance from the ego vehicle is substantial, and the trajectory is significantly different (the obstacle is moving at 11.0038 in a rightward direction). Thus, the distance is manageable.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Even though the obstacle is moving, the high velocity and angle of movement pose no imminent threat within the time to collision calculations (TTC is high due to significant distance in trajectory).
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 20039.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary, and its distance from the ego vehicle is moderate and controllable.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Being stationary means the TTC is effectively infinite, posing no immediate threat.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 20040.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Similar to Obstacle 20039, the position relative to the ego vehicle is controlled, and the ego can easily maneuver around.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: As it is also stationary, the collision time is not a concern.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

4. **Obstacle ID: 20041.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary and has a moderate distance from the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: No movement results in no immediate collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

5. **Obstacle ID: 20042.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary and also enough away from the ego vehicle, allowing for easy navigation.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Again, stationary means there’s no imminent collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

6. **Obstacle ID: 20043.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is in the same lanelet but reasonably distanced from the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: With a stationary state, TTC is not notable.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

7. **Obstacle ID: 20044.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance from the ego vehicle is controlled; it’s also stationary and not on a collision path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: No velocity implies no collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

8. **Obstacle ID: 20045.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Like others, this is stationary and poses no immediate risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Instantaneous collision risk is absent.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

9. **Obstacle ID: 20046.0, 20047.0, 20048.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: All stationary with ample distance from the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (for each)
   - **Time Risk reason**: All are stationary eliminating collision risks.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (for each)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (for each)

10. **Obstacle ID: 20050.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: The moving obstacle has significant distance from the ego and is traveling in a trajectory that will not intersect with the ego’s path.
    - **Distance safety score**: 5
    - **Time Risk reason**: The calculations indicate no immediate threat due to a safe trajectory and distance to potential collision.
    - **Time safety score**: 5
    - **Overall Risk score**: 5

11. **Obstacle ID: 20051.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is close but is decelerating; however, it's still able to potentially remain out of collision range.
    - **Distance safety score**: 3
    - **Time Risk reason**: TTC calculations indicate a collision may occur within a manageable timeframe, requiring attention.
    - **Time safety score**: 3
    - **Overall Risk score**: 3
    
12. **Obstacle ID: 20052.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Similar to 20051, this obstacle presents a closer distance and potential for collision if no action is taken.
    - **Distance safety score**: 3
    - **Time Risk reason**: TTC is low; rigorous management is essential.
    - **Time safety score**: 2
    - **Overall Risk score**: 2

13. **Obstacle ID: 20053.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Another moving obstacle with a high speed following a trajectory that may lead to intersection with the ego vehicle.
    - **Distance safety score**: 3
    - **Time Risk reason**: High probability of collision due to speed and distance; immediate attention required.
    - **Time safety score**: 2
    - **Overall Risk score**: 2
