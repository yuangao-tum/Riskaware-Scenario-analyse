### Safety analysis for timestep 4.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**General Note:**  Since lateral relative velocity is zero for most obstacles and very low where it's not, lateral TTC (TTClat) calculations become extremely sensitive to minor lateral distances, leading to unrealistically high or low TTC values. Given the context, focusing on longitudinal TTC (TTClong) provides a more practical risk assessment.  Lateral risk will be primarily assessed by Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) based on absolute lateral distance, considering the described motions.

**Calculations Explanation:**

* **TTClong:** Calculated as -DTClong / Vrel_long only if Vrel_long is negative (obstacle approaching).  If Vrel_long is positive, there is no longitudinal collision risk, and TTClong is considered infinite (represented by a large value for practical purposes).
* **MDC:** Calculated as the Euclidean distance using DTClong and DTClat.  Since most lateral movement is minimal, MDC is strongly influenced by DTClong.
