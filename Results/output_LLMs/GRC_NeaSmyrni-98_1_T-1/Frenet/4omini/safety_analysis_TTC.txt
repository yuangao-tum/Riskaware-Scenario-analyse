### Safety analysis for timestep 4.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID**: 20038.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is 165.21 m longitudinally and -27.44 m laterally away from the ego car, moving away longitudinally and laterally to the right. The distance is significant, indicating a minimal risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Since the obstacle is moving away and the distance is relatively large, the Time to Collision (TTC) is calculated as 165.21 m / 9.47 m/s = 17.43 seconds, which indicates no immediate risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

2. **Obstacle ID**: 20039.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance is 34.13 m longitudinally and -7.35 m laterally. This is relatively close; however, the high longitudinal negative velocity of -1.14 m/s indicates that the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC = 34.13 m / 1.14 m/s = 29.94 seconds. Although the distance is moderate, the obstacle is moving towards the ego car, providing sufficient time but still requiring attention.

   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC = 24.99 m / 1.14 m/s = 21.93 seconds, giving some time but posing a significant risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2

7. **Obstacle ID**: 20044.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: At 21.7 m longitudinally and -38.8 m laterally, it is nearing close proximity to the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC = 21.7 m / 1.14 m/s = 19.08 seconds, which is manageable but indicative of risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2

8. **Obstacle ID**: 20045.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at 18.09 m longitudinally and aligned laterally, the proximity heightens concern.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC = 18.09 m / 1.14 m/s = 15.87 seconds, indicating manageable time, but a significant risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2

9. **Obstacle ID**: 20046.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is 18.41 m longitudinally and -47.14 m laterally, also approaching the ego car.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC = 18.41 m / 1.14 m/s = 16.16 seconds. This situation is similar to the previous ones, with time to react.
   - **Time safety score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2

10. **Obstacle ID**: 20047.0
    - **Distance Risk reason**: At 15.83 m longitudinally and -53.67 m laterally, this obstacle presents a significant risk given its distance and approach.
    - **Distance safety score**: 2
    - **Time Risk reason**: TTC = 15.83 m / 1.14 m/s = 13.89 seconds, allowing limited time before potential collision.
    - **Time safety score**: 3
    - **Overall Risk score**: 2

11. **Obstacle ID**: 20048.0
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at 11.14 m longitudinally and centrally aligned laterally, extremely close and warrants concern.
    - **Distance safety score**: 1
    - **Time Risk reason**: TTC = 11.14 m / 1.14 m/s = 9.76 seconds, indicating urgent action is required to avoid colliding.
    - **Time safety score**: 2
    - **Overall Risk score**: 1

12. **Obstacle ID**: 20050.0
    - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is -15.56 m longitudinally and -155.91 m laterally, indicating it is approaching from behind and poses no immediate risk.
    - **Distance safety score**: 5
    - **Time Risk reason**: Given that it’s moving toward the ego car but from a far distance, the TTC is of no immediate concern.
    - **Time safety score**: 5
    - **Overall Risk score**: 5

13. **Obstacle ID**: 20051.0
    - **Distance Risk reason**: The direct collision with the ego car indicates an immediate threat as the distance is 0.0 m in both directions.
    - **Distance safety score**: 0
    - **Time Risk reason**: With a TTC of 0.0 seconds, a collision is inevitable, hence urgent action is required to avoid impact.
    - **Time safety score**: 0
    - **Overall Risk score**: 0

14. **Obstacle ID**: 20052.0
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at -14.18 m longitudinally, it’s a rear threat, which is manageable.
    - **Distance safety score**: 5
    - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC is considerable since it is behind the ego vehicle, indicating a negligibly low risk.
    - **Time safety score**: 5
    - **Overall Risk score**: 5

15. **Obstacle ID**: 20053.0
    - **Distance Risk reason**: At -23.47 m longitudinally and -175.94 m laterally, this poses minimal risk as it is still far behind the ego vehicle.
    - **Distance safety score**: 5
    - **Time Risk reason**: Again, due to significant distance, there is no risk of collision.
    - **Time safety score**: 5
    - **Overall Risk score**: 5
