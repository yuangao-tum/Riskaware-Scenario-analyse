  - **Distance Risk reason:** Very close at 24.99 m longitudinally and slightly off-center laterally (0.38 m), approaching ego car.
  - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Negative velocity, very close distance, significantly impacts the time to collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20044.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned at 21.7 m longitudinally and -38.8 m laterally, moving towards the ego car.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Approaching increases risk over time until collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20045.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Closer at 18.09 m longitudinally and in exact lateral alignment.
  - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Negative velocity indicating approach adds to the time risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20046.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Close longitudinal distance at 18.41 m, though quite far laterally (-47.14 m), moving towards the ego car.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Though the lateral distance reduces immediate risk, the longitudinal approach remains a factor.
  - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20047.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** At 15.83 m longitudinally, and a large lateral offset (-53.67 m), approaching the ego car.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is a concern despite lateral difference.
  - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20048.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Extremely close at 11.14 m longitudinally, exact lateral alignment, approaching the ego car.
  - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Nearly immediate risk with very short time to react.
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20050.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Behind at -15.56 m longitudinally and -155.91 m laterally, approaching but with a significant lateral offset.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Behind and fast moving, but the lateral distance provides minimal risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)
