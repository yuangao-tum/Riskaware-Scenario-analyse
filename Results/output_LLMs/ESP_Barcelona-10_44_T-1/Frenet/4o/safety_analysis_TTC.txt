### Safety analysis for timestep 10.2: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30714.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is 80.82 m with the obstacle moving away, lateral distance is increasing as well.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Positive relative velocity and increasing distances suggest no imminent collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30717.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is 19.62 m with the obstacle moving towards the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Negative relative velocity suggests a potential decreasing gap towards the ego car, but sufficient distance exists.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle 30718.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is 20.01 m, lateral distance is significant at 12.64 m.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Movements imply a possible closing trajectory, but sufficient time exists to handle it.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle 30727.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Distance is relatively low at 14.09 m longitudinally, but the obstacle is moving away.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Positive relative velocity implies an increasing gap with sufficient time.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle 30735.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Extremely close longitudinal distance of 0.11 m, likely below safe threshold.
- **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Significant risk due to proximity and negative relative velocity.
- **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
