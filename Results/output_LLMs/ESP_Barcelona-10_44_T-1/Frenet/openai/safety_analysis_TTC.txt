### Safety analysis for timestep 10.2s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30714.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 80.82 m and lateral distance -8.08 m, indicating a position far from the ego vehicle and moving away.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is 11.26 m/s longitudinally, indicating no likelihood of collision due to the distance and movement away.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30717.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance of 19.62 m is moderately close, though motion towards the ego car persists.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: With a longitudinal relative velocity of -2.73 m/s, there is a potential for collision, but adequate time to react exists.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30718.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of 20.01 m and lateral distance of 12.64 m suggests a moderate risk as it is moving towards the ego car.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Negative relative velocities indicate it is approaching the ego car but similarly maintains manageable timing to react.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30721.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: 20.39 m longitudinally is close enough with an approaching threat.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: With the approaching speed, collision is likely as time reduces to impact.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30724.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Close with DTClong = 20.79 m and lateral threat.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Continued approach at -2.75 m/s indicates a serious concern but still maintainable.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30726.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Safe in terms of distance, but longitudinally approaching with a DTClong of 21.2 m.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Moving towards the vehicle can create a collision scenario but is currently manageable.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30727.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: 14.09 m distance is concerning.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2
  - **Time Risk reason**: Approaching rapidly at 5.92 m/s causes worry about impending collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 2
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30733.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Moderate risk with longitudinal distance 21.64 m.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinally moving towards the vehicle at a negative velocity.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30735.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Extremely close with 0.11 m longitudinal distance.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1
  - **Time Risk reason**: Negative velocity and advancing position indicate imminent collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 1
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30736.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: 3.2 m distance is critically close.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1
  - **Time Risk reason**: With the car advancing towards it, the situation is very serious.
  - **Time safety score**: 1
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30739.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of 1.66 m is extremely close and concerning.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1
  - **Time Risk reason**: Cause for concern with fast rate of approach could lead to collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 1
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1
