### Safety analysis for timestep 10.2s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

The following calculations assume constant relative acceleration.  More sophisticated models could be used if the data were available.  TTC is calculated only when the relative velocity indicates a closing motion.

**General Notes:**  Lateral motion is often less critical than longitudinal motion, particularly at lower speeds.  The lateral distance available for maneuvering also influences risk. This analysis assumes typical roadway widths and vehicle sizes, but a more precise risk assessment would incorporate road geometry and lane information.
