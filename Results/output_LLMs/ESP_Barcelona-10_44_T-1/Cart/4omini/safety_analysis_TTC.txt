Safety analysis for the last timestep (10.2 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 10.2: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30714.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is moving at a high speed (14.0175) towards the ego vehicleâ€™s current position. Relative trajectory suggests imminent approach.
   - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk). 
   - Time Risk reason: TTC is low (< 1 second) given the obstacle's velocity and distance from the ego vehicle.
   - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk). 
   - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk).

2. **Obstacle ID: 30717.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary and relatively close, while the ego vehicle is dynamic.
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk). 
   - Time Risk reason: Since the obstacle is stationary, TTC is reasonably adequate, but proximity remains a concern.
   - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk). 
   - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).

3. **Obstacle ID: 30727.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is moving at 9.2643 and is well-aligned with the ego vehicle's path.
   - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk). 
   - Time Risk reason: TTC to collision is less than 2 seconds, considering substantial velocity of the obstacle.
   - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk). 
   - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk).

4. **Obstacle ID: 30735.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Moving at 6.0421, closing distance quickly.
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk). 
   - Time Risk reason: Moderate TTC suggesting manageable but risky conditions.
   - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk). 
   - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).

5. **Obstacle ID: 30736.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Similar trajectory with a significant approach speed.
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk).
   - Time Risk reason: Moderate TTC, but high speed correlates to potential risk.
   - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk).
   - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).

6. **Obstacle ID: 30738.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Rapid approach from a large distance.
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk).
   - Time Risk reason: Given the high velocity and proximity, collision is plausible soon; TTC is moderate but reasonable.
   - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk).
   - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).

7. **Obstacle ID: 30739.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: High moving speed but less direct approach.
   - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk).
   - Time Risk reason: Short TTC due to relative approach speed.
   - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk).
   - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk).

8. **Obstacle ID: 30744.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Risk due to moving close in the same lane.
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk). 
   - Time Risk reason: TTC remains manageable but proximity is a concern.
   - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk).
   - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).

9. **Obstacle ID: 30749.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Moving obstacle with a risk due to high velocity.
   - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk).
   - Time Risk reason: Short TTC due to dynamic surrounding.
   - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk).
   - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk).
