Safety analysis for timestep 10.2 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 10.2 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30714
  - Relative Direction: Front-right
  - Distance Risk Reason: The DTC longitudinal (80.82) is significantly high, indicating no risk of collision. The DTC lateral (8.08) is also manageable. Thus, the overall distance risk is low.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5 (rounded to 5)
  - Time Risk Reason: Both TTI are infinity, indicating no risk of collision based on time calculations.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30717
  - Relative Direction: Front-left
  - Distance Risk Reason: The DTC longitudinal (19.62) is under 20 but not close enough for a high risk score. The DTC lateral (5.13) is also acceptable.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 3  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.5 (rounded to 4)
  - Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal TTC (7.19) is acceptable and lateral is infinity, so there is no immediate risk.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5 (rounded to 5)
  - Overall Risk Score: 4.5 (rounded to 5)

- Obstacle ID: 30718
  - Relative Direction: Front-left
  - Distance Risk Reason: The DTC longitudinal (20.01) is manageable; however, the lateral distance (12.64) indicates a risk.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 3  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.5 (rounded to 4)
  - Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal TTC (7.32) with infinity lateral means a manageable risk.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5 (rounded to 5)
  - Overall Risk Score: 4.5 (rounded to 5)

- Obstacle ID: 30735
  - Relative Direction: Front-right
  - Distance Risk Reason: The DTC longitudinal (0.11) indicates an immediate risk of collision. The DTC lateral (16.14) is acceptable.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 2.5 (rounded to 3)
  - Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal TTC (0.06) indicates an imminent collision, while lateral is infinity, creating urgency.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 3 (using dominant weight).
  - Overall Risk Score: 3 (based on DSC and TSC).

- Obstacle ID: 30740
  - Relative Direction: Right
  - Distance Risk Reason: Both distances for collision (0.0 and 9.04) indicate an immediate risk of collision.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 2.5 (rounded to 3)
  - Time Risk Reason: TTC longitudinal (0.0) indicates an immediate collision, and lateral is infinity, indicating urgency.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 3 (using dominant weight).
  - Overall Risk Score: 3 (based on DSC and TSC).

- Obstacle ID: 30749
  - Relative Direction: Behind
  - Distance Risk Reason: Both values for DTC (0.11 and 0.0) indicate an immediate collision risk.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 1
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1
  - Time Risk Reason: Both TTC (0.03 and 0.0) indicate an imminent collision risk.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 0.5 (rounded to 0).
  - Overall Risk Score: 0 (based on DSC and TSC).
