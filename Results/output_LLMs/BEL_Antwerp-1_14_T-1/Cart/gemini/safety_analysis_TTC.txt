Safety analysis for the last timestep (9.8 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 9.8: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories, dimensions of vehicles, and lanelet geometries are not provided, I'm making simplified calculations based on Euclidean distances and assuming point-like vehicles.  A more robust analysis would require detailed trajectory predictions and shape information.  Furthermore, "relative direction" needs to be clarified. I will assume it implies if the objects are moving towards each other.  I use a threshold of 10 meters for MDC and 3 seconds for TTC to determine if the risk if higher than low. 

**Calculations** are approximated for demonstration:

**Example Calculation (Obstacle 30753):**

* **Distance:**  sqrt((30.2785 - 6.1172)^2 + (-115.9016 - -100.6281)^2) ≈ 26.5 meters
* **TTC (approximated):** Assuming constant velocity, and a collision course (worst-case for this simplified analysis), we would need more information about the relative heading to calculate TTC accurately.  Since the distance is fairly large, I'll estimate a high TTC for now.
* **Relative Direction:** Needs more vector information to determine precisely.

... (Repeat the above format for all obstacles.  The provided data suggests they are all relatively far from the ego vehicle, so the risk scores are likely to be 4 or 5 for most, if not all, using this simplified method).

- Obstacle ID: 30761
- Distance Risk reason: DTC ≈ 31m
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Since the obstacle is stationary, TTC is undefined or infinite if the ego vehicle is not on a direct collision course. With proper steering, no collision should occur.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30769
- Distance Risk reason: DTC ≈ 32m
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Low velocity obstacle.  TTC likely high.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

...(And so on for the remaining obstacles)
