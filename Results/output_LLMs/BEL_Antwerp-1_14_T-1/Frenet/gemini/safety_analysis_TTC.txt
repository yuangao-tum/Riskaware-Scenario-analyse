### Safety analysis for timestep 9.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

Calculations for TTC and MDC aren't straightforward with the given data because the motion isn't necessarily uniform.  A sophisticated model considering acceleration would be ideal. However, with the available data, we make simplified calculations (primarily using velocity) and rely heavily on qualitative motion descriptions to account for the acceleration component.

**General Approach:**

* **TTC (Simplified):** Distance / Relative Velocity.  A negative TTC implies the object is moving away. If the relative velocity is close to zero, and the distance is small and decreasing (based on the motion description), we consider it a high risk. If the relative velocity is zero and distance is already very small, it represents a collision (TTC=0).

* **MDC (Estimate):** We don't have enough information for a precise MDC. We infer the risk based on current distance and the motion description.



**Individual Obstacle Assessments:**

- **Obstacle ID: 30753.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Moderately far behind and to the right, but moving closer laterally.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, but the lateral motion presents some risk.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30754.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Far behind and to the left, but moving closer laterally.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, lateral movement isn't immediately concerning.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30755.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Close in front and to the right, moving closer longitudinally.
    - Distance safety score: 2
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching quickly longitudinally. Lateral motion is away from ego.
    - Time safety score: 2
    - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30756.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Moderately far behind and almost directly behind, but moving closer laterally.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally. Lateral velocity is low.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 30757.0**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Directly to the right and quite close, moving closer laterally.
    - Distance safety score: 2
    - Time Risk reason: Although longitudinally aligned currently, the lateral movement is a major concern.
    - Time safety score: 2
    - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30759.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Far behind and to the right, moving away.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away in both directions.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5
