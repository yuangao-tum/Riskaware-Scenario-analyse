### Safety analysis for timestep 2.8 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 30.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 23.71 m but closing in with -1.5 m/s (0.013 s per meter). The lateral distance of 10.24 m does not indicate immediate lateral risk.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC for longitudinal is 15.81 seconds (23.71 / 1.5) and for lateral is 5.49 seconds (10.24 / 1.86), indicating sufficient time to react before a potential collision.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 33.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance of 25.45 m and closing at -2.08 m/s. Lateral distance of 40.49 m poses minimal threat.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC longitudinally is 12.23 seconds (25.45 / 2.08) and laterally 23.25 seconds (40.49 / 1.74), providing ample time for action.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 315.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance of 20.0 m is closing at -4.2 m/s, with a lateral distance of just 2.85 m posing some risk.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC longitudinally is 4.76 seconds (20.0 / 4.2) and none laterally as it is very close. Lower score due to proximity.
  - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 317.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 23.24 m closing at -5.33 m/s, lateral distance is quite close at 1.08 m.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC is 4.36 seconds (23.24 / 5.33) and very low laterally, indicating a risk of collision.
  - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 320.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinally 31.41 m and a much closer alignment laterally (0.0) but closing in fast at -4.58 m/s.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC longitudinally is 6.87 seconds (31.41 / 4.58) with critical lateral closure.
  - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 324.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Faster moving away obstacle at a longitudinal distance of 44.52 m and lateral -1.23 m.
  - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: With a clear distance ahead, no significant risk is posed.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 325.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Down the lane concern at 41.86 m longitudinally and just 0.0 laterally, still approaching -3.2 m/s.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC is about 13.05 seconds (41.86 / 3.2) indicating that while safe longitudinally, lateral placement is a concern.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 329.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: 55.89 m away longitudinally and 0.0 m laterally, moving toward ego vehicle longitudinally indicates some concern.
  - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC longitudinally is 19.23 seconds (55.89 / 2.91) indicating suitable time.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 333.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinally 0.06 m nearly past the vehicle, concerning threat from behind.
  - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Negative TTC indicates you're about to be rear-ended.
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 338.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: 21.02 m behind indicates a considerable threat at a good speed.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Negative TTC indicates imminent collision possibility.
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 1
