### Safety analysis for timestep 2.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Moderately close longitudinally (23.71m) and laterally (10.24m) in the front-left.  Moving closer both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching relatively slowly, providing some time to react.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 33.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Further away longitudinally (25.45m) than Obstacle 30, but significantly further laterally (40.49m) in the front-left.  Moving closer both longitudinally and laterally, but lateral distance is substantial.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The closing speed is moderate, providing reasonable time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


**- Obstacle ID: 315.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively close longitudinally (20.0m) and laterally (2.85m) in the front-left.  Moving closer longitudinally but moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  The longitudinal closing speed is concerning (-4.2 m/s), requiring attention.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 317.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Close longitudinally (23.24m) and very close laterally (1.08m) in the front-left. Moving closer longitudinally but slightly away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  High longitudinal closing speed (-5.33 m/s) presents a significant risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 320.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Reasonably far longitudinally (31.41m) and directly in front. Moving closer longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Moderate closing speed provides some time to react.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 324.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Far away (44.52m) in the front-right and moving further away both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, posing no immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 325.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far longitudinally (41.86m) and directly in front. Moving closer longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Low closing speed offers ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 329.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Far away (55.89m) in front and moving closer longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Very low closing speed provides ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 333.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close (almost touching) directly behind. Moving away longitudinally. The negative distance suggests it might be slightly overlapping with the ego vehicle's rear boundary.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  Although moving away longitudinally, the extreme proximity poses a risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 338.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Moderately far behind (-21.02m) and moving closer.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving closer but with sufficient distance to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
