   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

2. **Obstacle ID: 33.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: DTC longitudinally is 25.45 m and laterally is 40.49 m, suggesting a safe distance.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **TTC Calculation**:
     - Longitudinal TTC: 25.45 m / 2.08 m/s = 12.23 s
     - Lateral TTC: 40.49 m / 1.74 m/s = 23.25 s
   - **Time Risk reason**: Plenty of time is available to react based on TTC values.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 315.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The DTC longitudinally is 20.0 m and laterally 2.85 m. The lateral distance indicates a closer position despite the longitudinal distance being safe.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3
   - **TTC Calculation**:
     - Longitudinal TTC: 20.0 m / 4.2 m/s = 4.76 s
     - Lateral TTC: 2.85 m / 0.1 m/s = 28.5 s
   - **Time Risk reason**: The longitudinal TTC is relatively short and should be monitored closely.
   - **Time safety score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

4. **Obstacle ID: 317.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: A DTC of 23.24 m longitudinally and 1.08 m laterally indicates a risk of lateral collision due to closeness.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3
   - **TTC Calculation**:
     - Longitudinal TTC: 23.24 m / 5.33 m/s = 4.36 s
     - Lateral TTC: 1.08 m / 0.19 m/s = 5.68 s
   - **Time Risk reason**: The longitudinal TTC is concerning as it is short, indicating a need for quick action.
   - **Time safety score**: 2
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2

5. **Obstacle ID: 320.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The DTC longitudinally is 31.41 m while laterally it is 0.0 m, suggesting potential direct collision.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2
   - **TTC Calculation**:
     - Longitudinal TTC: 31.41 m / 4.58 m/s = 6.86 s
     - Lateral TTC: (not quantifiable as it's 0, implies possible collision)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Although longitudinally the risk is not immediate, the zero lateral distance poses a high risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 2
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2

6. **Obstacle ID: 324.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: It has a DTC longitudinally of 44.52 m and laterally of -1.23 m, indicating it is moving away laterally but at risk of intersecting path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **TTC Calculation**:
     - Longitudinal TTC: 44.52 m / 11.41 m/s = 3.90 s
     - Lateral TTC: (moving away) = not a collision risk.
   - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinally safe with no immediate collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

7. **Obstacle ID: 325.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: DTC is 41.86 m longitudinally and 0.0 m laterally, presenting a risk of collision due to the lateral position.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2
   - **TTC Calculation**:
     - Longitudinal TTC: 41.86 m / 3.2 m/s = 13.09 s
     - Lateral TTC: (not quantifiable, as it’s 0)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The lateral position signals a high risk of collision.
   - **Time safety score**: 2
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2

8. **Obstacle ID: 329.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The DTC longitudinally is 55.89 m and laterally is 0.0 m, indicating an immediate collision risk laterally.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2
   - **TTC Calculation**:
     - Longitudinal TTC: 55.89 m / 2.91 m/s = 19.21 s
     - Lateral TTC: (not quantifiable as it’s 0)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Similar to other obstacles with 0 lateral distance, there is an imminent risk of lateral collision.
   - **Time safety score**: 2
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2

9. **Obstacle ID: 333.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The DTC longitudinally is -0.06 m (immediate overlap) with no lateral separation.
   - **Distance safety score**: 1
   - **TTC Calculation**:
     - Longitudinal TTC: Not calculable due to overlap (immediate collision).
     - Lateral TTC: Not applicable.
   - **Time Risk reason**: Immediate collision engagement.
   - **Time safety score**: 1
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1

10. **Obstacle ID: 338.0**
