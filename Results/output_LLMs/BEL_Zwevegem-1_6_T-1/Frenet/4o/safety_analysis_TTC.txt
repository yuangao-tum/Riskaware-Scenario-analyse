### Safety analysis for timestep 2.8 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is relatively close longitudinally (23.71 m) and laterally (10.24 m), with a slow closing velocity.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: With relatively slow closing velocities (-1.5 m/s longitudinally and -1.86 m/s laterally), the time to collision is significantly extended.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

2. **Obstacle ID: 33.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is farther at 25.45 m longitudinally and 40.49 m laterally. Further positioning indicates low immediate risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low relative velocities suggest a negligible chance of fast collision.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

3. **Obstacle ID: 315.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Given a close distance (20.0 m longitudinally, 2.85 m laterally), the obstacle poses a risk mainly due to its proximity.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2
   - **Time Risk reason**: With higher closing velocities (-4.2 m/s longitudinally), a moderate TTC indicates medium risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

4. **Obstacle ID: 317.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is very near longitudinally (23.24 m) and extremely close laterally (1.08 m).
   - **Distance safety score**: 1
   - **Time Risk reason**: Fast closing longitudinal velocity (-5.33 m/s) signifies an imminent collision threat, thus extreme risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 1
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1

5. **Obstacle ID: 320.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance (31.41 m) longitudinally indicates some buffer, but direct frontal alignment requires attention.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3
   - **Time Risk reason**: Negative longitudinal velocity (-4.58 m/s) suggests a manageable time risk with prompt action.
   - **Time safety score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

6. **Obstacle ID: 324.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is moving away both longitudinally and laterally with a significant distance.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Movement away ensures no collision possibility shortly.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

7. **Obstacle ID: 325.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Though frontally aligned at 41.86 m, slower closing velocity decreases risk levels.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Modest relative velocity results in lower urgency in collision prevention tactics.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

8. **Obstacle ID: 329.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned 55.89 m away, offering ample room before posing a real threat.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Movement toward ego vehicle but slow progress ensures minimal TTC impact.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

9. **Obstacle ID: 333.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located right behind (-0.06 m) with very high approach velocity.
   - **Distance safety score**: 1
   - **Time Risk reason**: Expected immediate collision due to negligible distance and high relative velocity.
   - **Time safety score**: 1
   - **Overall Risk score**: 0

10. **Obstacle ID: 338.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Approaching from behind with a safe 21.02 m distance.
    - **Distance safety score**: 4
    - **Time Risk reason**: Backward velocity suggests moderate attention on the time front.
    - **Time safety score**: 4
    - **Overall Risk score**: 4
