Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.8 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories, dimensions of vehicles, and lanelet geometries are not provided, I will make reasonable assumptions for demonstration.  I'll assume a simplified collision cylinder around each vehicle and focus on relative positions and velocities to estimate risk.  A more robust analysis would require detailed trajectory prediction and consideration of vehicle shapes.  I'll also assume lanelets 39405 and 38214 are adjacent and roughly parallel.


**Calculations (Illustrative):**

I will illustrate the calculations for Obstacle 333 and Ego Vehicle, then provide summarized risk assessments for the other obstacles.

**Ego vs. Obstacle 333:**

* **Position Difference:** Obstacle 333 is at (-544.73711, 479.6677) and Ego is at (-548.627, 477.2703). The difference is (3.88989, 2.3974).
* **Velocity Difference:** Obstacle 333 has a velocity of 12.334423 and Ego has a velocity of 1.8971.  The difference is 10.437323. This suggests Obstacle 333 is approaching Ego rapidly from behind.
* **Illustrative TTC (Longitudinal):** Assuming a 1D model and focusing on the x-coordinate difference (3.88989 meters) and velocity difference (10.437323 m/s), we get an approximate TTC of 3.88989 / 10.437323 â‰ˆ 0.37 seconds.  This is extremely dangerous.
* **Illustrative MDC:** Since Obstacle 333 is approaching Ego rapidly, the MDC will likely be close to zero unless Ego or Obstacle 333 takes evasive action.
