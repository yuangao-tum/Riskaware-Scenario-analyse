  - **Time Risk reason**: The velocities and positions indicate that there is no immediate threat of collision as they are moving in separate lanes.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 33.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned significantly ahead and in a different lanelet, 38029.0.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle moves away from the ego vehicle, reducing interaction potential.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 315.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 39809.0, away from the ego vehicle's path.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Different directional movement and lanelet ensure no immediate time-related collision risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 317.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Situated in lanelet 39022.0, with substantial lateral distance from the ego vehicle.

  - **Time Risk reason**: Higher velocity but away from the ego vehicle's direct path.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 320.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in lanelet 38854.0, further from the ego lanelet.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: The trajectory and velocity ensure movement away from the ego vehicle.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 324.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: In lanelet 37691.0, travelling at higher speed but distanced based on lane separation.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity indicates minimal interaction with the ego vehicle due to different paths.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 325.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: In lanelet 39024.0 with substantial separation from the ego path.

  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 329.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Far from ego vehicle and located in lanelet 37690.0.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Moving at low speed and maintaining distance.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 333.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned within the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, 39405.0, but moving swiftly in the opposite direction.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: High-speed approach indicates a potential moderating risk which needs attention but is manageable.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 338.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Although in proximity, in a differing lanelet 38214.0, with sufficient separation.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Higher speed but doesn't approach the ego vehicle's lane.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5
