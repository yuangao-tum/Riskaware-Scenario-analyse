Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.8 seconds):
To conduct the collision analysis, I will first examine the provided information, particularly focusing on the location, velocity, and acceleration of the ego vehicle and the obstacles.

### 1. Identify Obstacles in the Same Lanelet or Trajectory as the Ego Vehicle:
The ego vehicle is located in lanelet 39405.0. Therefore, I will analyze the obstacles located also in lanelet 39405.0 or in a trajectory that makes them relevant. The only obstacle in the same lanelet is:

- **Obstacle 333 (Position: (-544.73711, 479.6677))**

### 2. Calculate Metrics:

#### For Obstacle 333:
- **Ego Velocity**: 1.8971 m/s
- **Ego Position**: (-548.627, 477.2703)
- **Obstacle Velocity**: 12.334423 m/s
- **Obstacle Position**: (-544.73711, 479.6677)

#### Length and Distance Calculations:
To evaluate the risk, I will calculate the linear distance between the ego vehicle and this obstacle.

1. **Calculate the distance** between the ego and the obstacle:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(-544.73711 + 548.627)^2 + (479.6677 - 477.2703)^2} 
   \]
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(3.88989)^2 + (2.3974)^2} 
   \]
   \[
   \text{Distance} \approx \sqrt{15.15196 + 5.74805} \approx \sqrt{20.90001} \approx 4.58 \text{ meters}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time to collision (TTC)**: 
   The relative velocity between the ego vehicle and the obstacle must be considered:
   \[
   \text{Relative Velocity} = \text{Obstacle Velocity} - \text{Ego Velocity} = 12.334423 - 1.8971 = 10.437323 \text{ m/s}
   \]
   \[
   \text{TTC} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Velocity}} = \frac{4.58}{10.437323} \approx 0.439 \text{ seconds}
   \]

#### Summary of Calculated Values for Obstacle 333:
- **Minimum Distance (MDC)**: 4.58 m
- **Time to Collision (TTC)**: 0.439 s
  
### 3. Evaluating Risks:
#### Distance Analysis:
- The Minimum Distance of 4.58 meters indicates a closeness, but the actual risk is determined more by the TTC.

#### Time Analysis:
- With a TTC of approximately 0.439 seconds, there is a high likelihood of collision imminent immediately.

### Safety Analysis For Timestep 2.8 Seconds:
### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 333
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The minimum distance of 4.58 meters is close and could indicate an impending collision.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The TTC of 0.439 seconds suggests an immediate collision risk, demanding urgent action.
- **Time Safety Score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
