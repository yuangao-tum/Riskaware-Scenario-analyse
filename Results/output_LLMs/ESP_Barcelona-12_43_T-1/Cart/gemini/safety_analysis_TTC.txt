Safety analysis for the last timestep (13.0 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 13.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories, dimensions of vehicles, and lanelet shapes are not provided, I will make reasonable assumptions for demonstration purposes.  I will primarily use Euclidean distance as a proxy for both longitudinal and lateral distances.  A more detailed analysis would require more information.  I will assume a safety "bubble" around the ego vehicle â€“ penetrating this bubble represents a collision risk.  For this example, let's consider distances under 5 meters as high risk, and under 10 meters as medium risk.

**Ego Vehicle Information:**
- Position: (-483.4472, 323.3343)
- Lanelet: 487.0
