Safety analysis for the last timestep (13.0 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 13.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

**Obstacle ID: 30690.0**
- Distance Risk reason: The ego vehicle is at (-483.4472, 323.3343) and the obstacle is at (-442.8842, 350.3174). The distance is approximately 44.44 meters. However, the obstacle is relatively stationary, posing a risk due to the ego vehicle's motion.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium risk due to moderate distance).
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary with a calculated TTC of approximately 5.39 seconds, indicating a manageable situation.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium risk due to sufficient time to react).
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium risk due to distance and time factors).

**Obstacle ID: 30691.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Similar analysis as above yields a minimum distance of approximately 46.65 meters, which is manageable.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low risk due to greater distance).
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's minimal velocity (0.0001) provides a TTC of 5.69 seconds, indicating further time to react.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low risk due to ample reaction time).
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low risk due to favorable metrics).

**Obstacle ID: 30695.0**
- Distance Risk reason: The ego vehicle is at (-483.4472, 323.3343) and the moving obstacle at (-487.4814, 409.4802) produces a distance of approximately 90.45 meters. 
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low risk given sufficient distance).
- Time Risk reason: TTC calculated based on the obstacle's speed yields 6.46 seconds, allowing for enough time to react.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low risk due to ample response time).
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low risk overall).

---

**Obstacle ID: 30696.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Minimum distance of approximately 72.07 meters. The distance is sufficient to avoid risks.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low risk due to significant distance).
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle moves with a speed of 10.3163 m/s, leading to a TTC of 7.37 seconds.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low risk).
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low risk).

---

**Obstacle ID: 30710.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Positioned at (-434.7087, 376.366) with a distance of approximately 54.63 meters, which provides a decent buffer.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium risk).
- Time Risk reason: The slower speed of this obstacle again produces a TTC close to 6.55 seconds.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium risk).
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium risk overall).

---

**Obstacle ID: 30716.0**
- Distance Risk reason: The ego vehicle could also be influenced by the location of this moving obstacle at a distance of approximately 71.23 meters.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low risk).
- Time Risk reason: This obstacle has a speed of 11.8042 m/s which leads to a TTC of 6.82 seconds, relatively safe.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low risk).
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low risk overall).

---

**Obstacle ID: 30720.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Distance of approximately 99.85 meters to the ego vehicle, minimizing risk.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible risk).
- Time Risk reason: Moving with a slightly reduced speed of 11.2541 m/s, resulting in a TTC of 8.84 seconds.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low risk).
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low risk overall).
