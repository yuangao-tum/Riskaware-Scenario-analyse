### Safety analysis for timestep 13.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**General Notes:**  Since precise ego vehicle motion isn't given, TTC calculations assume *constant* relative velocity and acceleration. This is a simplification.  Lateral movement is often less predictable, requiring more cautious scoring.  "Moving away" obstacles still require monitoring due to potential unforeseen changes in their motion.

- **Obstacle ID: 30690.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located behind and to the left of the ego vehicle at a reasonable distance.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30691.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located behind and to the left, moderate longitudinal distance but closing laterally.
    - Distance safety score: 4
