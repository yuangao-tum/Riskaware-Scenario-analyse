### Safety analysis for timestep 13.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30690**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is -43.34 m and lateral distance is 7.54 m. It is moving away longitudinally; thus, the risk is minimal.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal relative velocity is -7.86 m/s. TTC = -43.34 / -7.86 = 5.5 seconds, indicating manageable risk.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30691**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is -43.17 m and lateral distance is 15.04 m. This obstacle is approaching laterally but still at a safe distance.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Lateral approach with a longitudinal velocity of -7.86 m/s results in TTC = 5.5 seconds.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30695**
  - Distance Risk reason: Real distance at -52.94 m longitudinally and -62.71 m laterally. Both are safe distances away from collision.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal velocity -7.73 m/s leads to TTC = 6.86 seconds.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30700**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is -43.11 m and lateral distance is 22.54 m. Moving away longitudinally but approaching laterally; however, distance is reasonable.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal velocity -7.86 m/s results in TTC = 5.5 seconds.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30701**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance -43.12 m and lateral distance -30.05 m. Approaching laterally poses low risk due to distance.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal velocity -7.86 m/s gives TTC = 5.5 seconds.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30716**
  - Distance Risk reason: Exact longitudinal and lateral alignment with the ego car indicates collision risk.
  - Distance safety score: 0 (Collision)
  - Time Risk reason: Relative velocity longitudinal is 3.95 m/s, indicating immediate collision.
  - Time safety score: 0 (Collision)
  - Overall Risk score: 0
