### Safety analysis for timestep 13.0 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30690.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is -43.34 m and lateral distance is 7.54 m. The relative motion is such that the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, while there is no lateral relative motion, indicating a manageable distance but with possible concern for proximity due to the lateral component.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The longitudinal relative velocity is -7.86 m/s. Therefore, the TTC (using the absolute value of the longitudinal distance divided by the relative velocity) is approximately 5.5 seconds. This indicates sufficient time to react.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30691.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is -43.17 m and lateral distance is 15.04 m. The obstacle is moving toward the ego car laterally, which introduces potential risk despite the longitudinal component being manageable.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Similar to the previous, longitudinal velocity is -7.86 m/s, leading to a TTC of approximately 5.5 seconds. This allows for moderate reaction time, but the lateral movement requires attention.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30695.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is -52.94 m and lateral distance is -62.71 m. The obstacle is moving away in both directions, indicating no immediate threat.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity longitudinally is -7.73 m/s, leading to a TTC of approximately 6.9 seconds. This indicates ample time for the ego vehicle to avoid any potential interaction.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

---

- **Obstacle ID**: 30696.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The distances are longitudinally -53.18 m and laterally -37.65 m with the obstacle moving away, effectively posing no immediate risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: With a TTC of approximately 6.9 seconds (given the -7.75 m/s velocity), reactions can be appropriately managed.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

---

- **Obstacle ID**: 30699.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is -53.56 m and lateral distance is -18.38 m. The obstacle is moving away, leading to minimal collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC is approximately 7.0 seconds, allowing for significant reaction time.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30700.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is -43.11 m and lateral distance is 22.54 m; relative motion is shifting laterally toward the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Relative motion provides a TTC of about 5.5 seconds, which is manageable but not optimal.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

---

- **Obstacle ID**: 30701.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinally -43.12 m, laterally 30.05 m. The obstacle is approaching laterally while moving away longitudinally. While distance is manageable, the potential for interaction is present.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: With the same relative speed as previous obstacles, the TTC remains at about 5.5 seconds.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

---

- **Obstacle ID**: 30716.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in collision at longitudinal 0.0 m and lateral 0.0 m, indicating an actual collision scenario.
  - **Distance safety score**: 0 (Collision)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity of 3.95 m/s indicates a direct collision path with no time for evasive action.
  - **Time safety score**: 0 (Collision)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 0 (Collision)

---

- **Obstacle ID**: 30710.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal -67.42 m and lateral -2.11 m; while moving away longitudinally, the obstacle is approaching laterally from the right.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC is approximately 59.7 seconds due to low relative velocity, allowing sufficient response time.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)
