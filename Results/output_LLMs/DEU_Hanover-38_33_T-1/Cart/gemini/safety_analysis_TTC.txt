Safety analysis for the last timestep (7.0 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 7.0s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories, dimensions of vehicles, and lanelet geometries aren't provided, I'm making simplified assumptions for demonstration:

* **TTC Longitudinal (TTClong):** Approximated using relative longitudinal velocities and distances.  A large positive TTClong means the obstacle is moving away or far ahead. A small positive TTClong suggests a potential rear-end collision. A negative TTClong indicates the ego vehicle is approaching the obstacle's rear.
* **TTC Lateral (TTClat):**  Approximated using lateral distances and assuming constant velocities. This simplification ignores potential lane changes and curved trajectories.  It provides a rough estimate of how soon vehicles might be side-by-side.
* **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):** Approximated by the Euclidean distance at the closest point of approach, assuming constant velocities and straight-line motion. This is a simplified representation, but useful for relative risk assessment.
* I am assuming a lane change maneuver takes roughly 2-3 seconds.  If an obstacle is in a different lane but has a low TTC (under 3 seconds), I am considering that a medium to high risk because of the possibility of unexpected lane changes by either vehicle.  If TTC is above 3, it will be considered low risk or no risk.

**Important Note:**  This analysis is a *demonstration* using simplified calculations.  A real autonomous driving system requires much more sophisticated collision checking, considering vehicle dynamics, sensor uncertainties, and predictive models of other agents' behavior.
