Safety analysis for the last timestep (7.0 seconds):
To analyze the provided scenario for potential collisions, we will follow the outlined steps and consider each obstacle's position, velocity, and its relation to the ego vehicle. 

### Step 1: Identify Obstacles in the Same Lanelet or Trajectory
The relevant lanelet for the ego vehicle is lanelet 65. The obstacles that are also in lanelet 65, which are likely candidates for collision analysis, are:
- Obstacle 30679
- Obstacle 30688
- Obstacle 30689
- Obstacle 30696
- Obstacle 30697

### Step 2: Calculate TTC and MDC
To calculate Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC), we will need to compute the distances between the ego vehicle and these obstacles, along with their velocities.

**Ego Vehicle Details**:
- Position: (-143.1272, -26.2849)
- Velocity: 1.6666 m/s

Let's process each obstacle.

#### For each obstacle, calculate the following:
1. **Relative Position**: Calculate relative positions of the obstacles.
2. **Distance**: Calculate the Euclidean distance.
3. **Relative Velocity**: Calculate the closing speed.
4. **TTC**: Calculate the time to collision using the formula \(TTC = \frac{Distance}{Closing Speed}\).
5. **MDC**: Determine minimum distance between the two vehicles.

**Detailed Calculations:**

1. **Obstacle 30679**
   - Position: (-162.1626, 2.3902)
   - Velocity: 5.974 m/s
   - Relative Position: \(D = \sqrt{((-162.1626 - (-143.1272))^2 + (2.3902 - (-26.2849))^2)} \approx 28.23\) m
   - Closing Speed: \(5.974 - 1.6666 \approx 4.3074\) m/s
   - TTC: \(TTC = \frac{28.23}{4.3074} \approx 6.55\) seconds
   - MDC: 28.23 m

2. **Obstacle 30688**
   - Position: (-140.7678, -30.3005)
   - Velocity: 5.4429 m/s
   - Relative Position: \(D \approx 2.63\) m
   - Closing Speed: \(5.4429 - 1.6666 \approx 3.7763\) m/s
   - TTC: \(TTC = \frac{2.63}{3.7763} \approx 0.695\) seconds
   - MDC: 2.63 m

3. **Obstacle 30689**
   - Position: (-154.6981, -8.5746)
   - Velocity: 5.7611 m/s
   - Relative Position: \(D \approx 11.76\) m
   - Closing Speed: \(5.7611 - 1.6666 \approx 4.0945\) m/s
   - TTC: \(TTC \approx 2.87\) seconds
   - MDC: 11.76 m

4. **Obstacle 30696**
   - Position: (-132.889, -39.9141)
   - Velocity: 5.1312 m/s
   - Relative Position: \(D \approx 11.41\) m
   - Closing Speed: \(5.1312 - 1.6666 \approx 3.4646\) m/s
   - TTC: \(TTC \approx 3.29\) seconds
   - MDC: 11.41 m

5. **Obstacle 30697**
   - Position: (-136.2109, -41.3315)
   - Velocity: 2.1132 m/s
   - Relative Position: \(D \approx 6.52\) m
   - Closing Speed: \(2.1132 - 1.6666 \approx 0.4466\) m/s
   - TTC: \(TTC \) is infinite as the closing speed is low and will not cause collision in short term
   - MDC: 6.52 m

### Step 3: Evaluation of Each Obstacle
Using the calculated TTC and MDC data, we can evaluate the safety scores for each obstacle:

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [
        {
            "ObstacleID": "30688",
            "OverallRiskScore": "0"
        }
    ],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
``` 

This analysis indicates that the greatest concern is the collision risk posed by Obstacle 30688, which requires immediate attention. Other obstacles pose a manageable risk.
