Safety analysis for the last timestep (7.0 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 7.0 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30679.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is located in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle with a relatively close position in terms of longitudinal alignment.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium risk due to proximity but manageable distance)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTClong is short due to significant relative speed in the same direction; prompt reaction needed.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30688.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet and near the ego vehicle but offset laterally by a moderate distance.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low risk as the lateral distance provides buffer)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Moderate risk due to different velocities, allowing for reaction time.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30689.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Shares the same lanelet; lateral distance is a moderate concern.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 
  - **Time Risk reason**: The similar velocity suggests managed collision risk over time.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30696.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned within close longitudinal proximity to the ego.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 
  - **Time Risk reason**: High relative velocity requires attention to TTC.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

### Detailed Reasoning:

The scenario involves multiple obstacles, many of which are in the immediate vicinity of the ego vehicle either in the same lanelet or in slightly different positions. No collision was detected (Overall Risk Score of 0), and no extreme risk situations (Overall Risk Score of 1) were identified based on calculated TTC and MDC metrics.

- **Obstacle 30679.0** poses a moderate risk due to its alignment in the same lanelet.
- **Obstacle 30688.0 and 30689.0** are closely separated laterally but moving in controlled scenarios suggesting low risk.
- **Obstacle 30696.0** involves moderate distance and relative motion, indicating a medium risk but manageable.

This analysis is based on estimating possible collision time frames and distances, focusing on the same lanelet dynamics. Overall, no immediate actions are required beyond typical monitoring of ego and obstacle dynamics.
