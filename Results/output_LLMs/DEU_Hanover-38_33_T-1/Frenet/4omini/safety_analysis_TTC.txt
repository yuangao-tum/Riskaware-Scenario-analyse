### Safety analysis for timestep 7.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30672.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 55.81 m and lateral is -34.04 m. The obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally and moving away laterally, indicating a fair distance but an impending potential impact.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal relative velocity of -2.74 m/s means it's moving towards the ego vehicle, making collision possible but not immediate. The TTC = Distance / Velocity = 55.81 / |(-2.74)| = 20.36 seconds (clear time), and lateral movement is safe due to some distance.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

2. **Obstacle ID: 30673.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 52.95 m; lateral is -48.55 m. Driving toward the car longitudinally but moving away laterally, indicating safe distance.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal relative velocity of -3.37 m/s. TTC = 52.95 / |(-3.37)| = 15.71 seconds.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 30674.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is 56.49 m; lateral is 0.0m. This distance gives extra room longitudinally, while laterally the obstacle is directly ahead.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity longitudinally is positive (4.98 m/s), indicating it's moving away, leading to a safe scenario. TTC is quite high.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

4. **Obstacle ID: 30677.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of 118.08 m; laterally -2.08 m behind. Safe distance and not in the path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC is high with a negative relative velocity longitudinally (-1.67 m/s), indicating no concern for collision. 
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5
   
5. **Obstacle ID: 30685.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Very close at longitudinal distance of 4.91 m, laterally 26.32 m. The proximity raises risk while moving away laterally.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2
   - **Time Risk reason**: A relative velocity of -15.35 m/s indicates a significant approach rate leading to a TTC = 4.91 / |(-15.35)| = 0.32 seconds.
   - **Time safety score**: 1
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1

6. **Obstacle ID: 30696.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of -12.53 m indicates it's behind the vehicle, heightening its risk as it moves toward the rear.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2
   - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal velocity of 3.46 m/s with a TTC of -12.53 / 3.46 which implies it will reach back within a short timeframe (3.62s but moving closer).
   - **Time safety score**: 2
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30685.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    }
}
``` 

### Conclusion:
In this analysis, only Obstacle ID 30685.0 presents an extreme risk due to proximity and motion towards it, whereas no obstacles present an imminent collision at this timestamp. Overall, the situation seems generally safe with sufficient time to react to potential risks.
