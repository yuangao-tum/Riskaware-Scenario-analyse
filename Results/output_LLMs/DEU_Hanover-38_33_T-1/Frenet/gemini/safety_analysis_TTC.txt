### Safety analysis for timestep 7.0s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Methodology:**

For each obstacle, we analyze the TTC and MDC.  Since we have both longitudinal and lateral components, we'll consider both. A negative TTC indicates the objects are moving away from each other. We prioritize the lower TTC (closest to collision) when both are positive.  MDC is calculated based on the current distance since constant velocity and acceleration are unreliable predictors over longer durations.

**Scoring Logic:**

The scoring combines TTC and MDC, emphasizing the immediacy of the threat (TTC).

* **TTC <= 2s and MDC small:** Score 0 or 1 (Collision Imminent/Extremely High Risk)
* **TTC 2s - 5s and MDC small:** Score 1 or 2 (High Risk)
* **TTC 5s-10s and/or moderate MDC:** Score 2 or 3 (Medium to High Risk)
* **TTC > 10s and large MDC:** Score 4 or 5 (Low to Negligible Risk)
