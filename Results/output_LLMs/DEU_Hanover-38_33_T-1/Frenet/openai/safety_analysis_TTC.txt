### Safety analysis for timestep 7.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID:** 30672.0
   - Distance Risk reason: DTC longitudinal (55.81 m) indicates a safe distance, but lateral (34.04 m) shows a notable position towards the ego car.
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: TTC longitudinal = 55.81 / (-2.74) = -20.36 seconds (negative indicates moving away, safe); TTC lateral = 34.04 / (-7.14) = -4.77 seconds (negative also indicates moving away).
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 4

2. **Obstacle ID:** 30673.0
   - Distance Risk reason: Similar distance characteristics and positioning suggest a reasonable distance.
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: TTC longitudinal = 52.95 / (-3.37) = -15.72 seconds; TTC lateral = 48.55 / (-7.02) = -6.91 seconds (both negative, indicating moving away).
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 4

3. **Obstacle ID:** 30674.0
   - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance (56.49 m) is safe; obstacle moving away in relation.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: TTC longitudinal = 56.49 / 4.98 = 11.35 seconds; lateral is not concerning.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

4. **Obstacle ID:** 30677.0
   - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance (118.08 m) is significantly safe, but driving towards it.
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: TTC longitudinal = 118.08 / (-1.67) = -70.67 seconds implies moving away; lateral is stable.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 4 

5. **Obstacle ID:** 30678.0
   - Distance Risk reason: Adequate distance longitudinally (61.56 m), remains safe.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: TTC is positive; sufficient margins away.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

6. **Obstacle ID:** 30679.0
   - Distance Risk reason: Close proximity longitudinally (29.89 m) being alarming.
   - Distance safety score: 3
   - Time Risk reason: TTC longitudinal = 29.89 / 4.31 = 6.92 seconds suggest immediate attention needed.
   - Time safety score: 4
   - Overall Risk score: 3

7. **Obstacle ID:** 30680.0
   - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal 108.8 m indicates a safe distance, driving towards the vehicle.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: While overall engagement isnâ€™t focused laterally, the safety remains high.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

8. **Obstacle ID:** 30681.0
   - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal 130.35 m very safe, but negative engagement remains evident.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: Moving lengthy away, thus no immediate risk.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

9. **Obstacle ID:** 30685.0
   - Distance Risk reason: Close proximity longitudinally (4.91 m) suggests imminent risk.
   - Distance safety score: 2
   - Time Risk reason: With high relative velocity -15.35 m/s longitudinally, collision is immediately likely.
   - Time safety score: 1
   - Overall Risk score: 1

10. **Obstacle ID:** 30694.0
   - Distance Risk reason: Close distance (8.53 m) indicates considerable risk.
   - Distance safety score: 2
   - Time Risk reason: High relative velocity implies looming impact.
   - Time safety score: 1
   - Overall Risk score: 1
