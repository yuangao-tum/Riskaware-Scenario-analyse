### Safety analysis for timestep 4.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 3242.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is at -81.05 m longitudinally and -9.67 m laterally. It is moving away longitudinally but is close enough that there is no immediate threat.
  - Distance safety score: 4
