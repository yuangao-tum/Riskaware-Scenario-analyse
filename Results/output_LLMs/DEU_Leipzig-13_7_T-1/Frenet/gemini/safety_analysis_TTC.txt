### Safety analysis for timestep 4.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**General Notes:**  TTC calculations assume constant velocity.  This is a simplification and real-world scenarios involve changing accelerations.  The motion descriptions are crucial context alongside the numerical data.  A negative TTC indicates that the relative velocity is moving the objects away from each other, even if they are currently close.

**Methodology:**

For each obstacle, I analyze TTC and MDC, combined with the motion description, to arrive at a risk score. The lower of the distance-based risk score and time-based risk score is chosen as the overall risk score to reflect the most immediate danger.
