Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.0 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories, dimensions of vehicles, and lanelet geometries aren't provided,  I'm making some simplified assumptions for demonstration:

* **Point Objects:** Vehicles are treated as point objects.
* **Straight-line Trajectories:**  We assume vehicles maintain their current velocity and heading (no turns considered within the short time horizon of TTC calculation).  This is a limitation, especially for longer TTC values.
* **TTC and MDC Approximations:** TTC and MDC are calculated based on these straight-line motion assumptions. In a real system, these would be much more complex, accounting for predicted paths.
* **Lanelet Information:** Lanelet information is used to broadly assess risk (same lane, adjacent lane, etc.).  Ideal analysis would use lanelet shapes and vehicle dimensions.

**Calculations:**
TTClong and TTClat are not calculated here due to complexity.  DTClong and DTClat are not calculated either, but would be based on position differences. The detailed analysis would involve vector projections to find longitudinal and lateral distances.
