Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.0 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

1. **Obstacle ID: 3244**
   - Distance Risk reason: Calculating distance using the positions of the ego vehicle and the obstacle shows that they are relatively close considering the velocities involved.
   - Distance safety score: **3** (Medium risk due to the proximity and the relative velocities)
   - Time Risk reason: Given the velocity of the obstacle and the ego vehicle, the time until a potential collision is reasonable and manageable.
   - Time safety score: **4** (Low risk since reaction time is sufficient)
   - Overall Risk score: **3** (Medium risk due to manageable situation)

2. **Obstacle ID: 3254**
   - Distance Risk reason: The distance is short given both vehicles are on a collision path directly. 
   - Distance safety score: **2** (High risk due to proximity and rapid velocities)
   - Time Risk reason: The time to collision is also getting smaller based on their speeds and direction.
   - Time safety score: **2** (High risk due to potential for collision)
   - Overall Risk score: **2** (High risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 3251**
   - Distance Risk reason: A moderate distance is observed, but the relative velocity suggests a close interaction.
   - Distance safety score: **3** (Medium risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The time to reach potential collision is reasonable but may require quick actions to mitigate.
   - Time safety score: **3** (Medium risk)
   - Overall Risk score: **3** (Medium risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 3256**
   - Distance Risk reason: Reasonable distance is maintained, hence significantly safe.
   - Distance safety score: **4** (Low risk)
   - Time Risk reason: A fairly long time until any potential collision is observed, allowing for adjustments.
   - Time safety score: **4** (Low risk)
   - Overall Risk score: **4** (Low risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 3253**
   - Distance Risk reason: The distance here indicates a good separation, with the obstacle moving slower.
   - Distance safety score: **4** (Low risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The time to collision is sufficient giving maneuverability.
   - Time safety score: **4** (Low risk)
   - Overall Risk score: **4** (Low risk)

6. **Obstacle ID: 3262**
   - Distance Risk reason: It presents a larger distance from the ego vehicle compared to others listed.
   - Distance safety score: **5** (Negligible risk)
   - Time Risk reason: There is a very lengthy time until potential collision, making risks negligible.
   - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible risk)
   - Overall Risk score: **5** (Negligible risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:

{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
``` 

### Conclusive Remarks:
In summary, the majority of obstacles present a manageable risk with no immediate collision scenario based on the analyzed metrics but show variation where high risk may occur (particularly with obstacles 3244 and 3254). A proactive approach should be taken for these identified risks, enabling the ego vehicle to maintain safe operation while adapting to dynamic surroundings.
