Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.0 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Assume longitudinal distance is along the x-axis, lateral is along the y-axis, and the calculations for TTC and MDC use basic kinematics and Euclidean distances in 2D.
