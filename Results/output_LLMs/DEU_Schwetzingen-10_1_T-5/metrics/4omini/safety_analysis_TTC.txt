Safety analysis for timestep 6.5 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 6.5 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20071
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance (2.1) is manageable, while lateral distance (4.39) indicates a safe lateral position. Thus, both metrics contribute to a low risk.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 3  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.5
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal TTC is significantly large (1314.14), indicating no immediate risk, while lateral TTC is infinity. Both of these suggest low risk.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Risk Score: 4

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20072
- Relative Direction: Front-left

- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 2  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.5
- Time Risk Reason: High TTC for both directions (2075.13 longitudinal and infinity lateral) indicates no immediate collision risk.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Risk Score: 4

### Obstacle Analysis:
