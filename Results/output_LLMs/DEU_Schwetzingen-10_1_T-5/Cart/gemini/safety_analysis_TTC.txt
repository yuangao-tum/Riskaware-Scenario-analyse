Safety analysis for the last timestep (6.5 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 6.5s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories, dimensions of vehicles, and lanelet geometries are not provided, a simplified analysis based on Euclidean distances and relative velocities is performed. A safety buffer distance is conceptually considered for assigning risk scores, although a specific numerical value isn't used in the absence of vehicle dimensions.  The relative direction is qualitatively assessed based on position and orientation differences. TTC is approximated based on current velocities and distances.

**### Obstacle Analysis:**

- **Obstacle ID: 20071.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively close, same longitudinal position.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Stationary, ego moving slowly. Low risk unless ego accelerates towards the obstacle.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 20072.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Further away than 20071, similar lateral position.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20074.0 - 20086.0, 20091.0 - 20109.0, 20114.0**
- Distance Risk reason: These obstacles are progressively further away along a roughly parallel path to the ego vehicle, likely in adjacent lanelets.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20088.0 - 20100.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located far on the opposite side of the road (positive x coordinates while ego is in negative x coordinates).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20113.0, 20117.0, 20122.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Far away, different lanelets. 20113, 20117 and 20122 are moving away from ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20119.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively far and moving perpendicular to the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away, unlikely to intersect ego's path.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20120.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Some lateral distance, different lanelets. Moving towards ego vehicle but lanelets seems different.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Some risk if ego vehicle changes lanes or 20120 crosses into ego's lane.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20121.0, 20124.0, 20126.0, 20128.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located far from the ego vehicle, different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Moving roughly parallel but far, assuming they remain within respective lanelets.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20129.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Laterally separated and moving in opposite direction.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 20130.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively close behind the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving faster than ego but same direction, potential for rear-end collision if ego decelerates abruptly or 20130 does not brake.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 20131.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Further away than 20130, similar trajectory behind ego.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving in same general direction but ego is decelerating.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
