Safety analysis for the last timestep (6.5 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 6.5: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 20071.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is at a position of (-23.0123, -6.3584), which is approximately 8.3254 units away from the ego vehicle's position. This distance does not imply an imminent collision.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk).
