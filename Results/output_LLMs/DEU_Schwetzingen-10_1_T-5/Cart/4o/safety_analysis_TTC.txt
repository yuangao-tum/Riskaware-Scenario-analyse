Safety analysis for the last timestep (6.5 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 6.5 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 20071
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is positioned noticeably displaced in the lateral direction from the ego vehicle and stationary. Considering the ego's orientation and low velocity, the lateral distance remains safe.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: With the ego vehicle almost stationary and both having no significant motion towards each other, the TTC remains sufficiently high or infinite.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20072
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is significantly laterally offset from the ego vehicle's lane at a reasonable distance.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Being stationary and at lateral distance, no immediate trajectory intersects.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20074
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is similar in positioning and lateral displacement as previous ones and is not in the path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: No impending trajectory overlap. Stationary.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20077
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned much laterally offset; stationary. Safe distance maintained.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Idle both entities and no intersecting route predicted.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20078
- **Distance Risk reason**: At considerable lateral offset, with no forward movement towards the ego.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Static position significantly away in both dimensions.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20082
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at far lateral distance; static position.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: No motion; trajectory does not intersect.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20086
- **Distance Risk reason**: At a distance laterally and longitudinally where it poses no threat.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Stationary; positioned away.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20088
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located far away in a different lanelet with no movement aimed towards the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Stationary and distant; no expected convergence.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20089
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned significantly far; not in the same trajectory or pose an immediate risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: No motion and vast separation in potential collision path.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20090
- **Distance Risk reason**: Very far, both laterally and potentially facing away or in a non-converging direction.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: No velocity change anticipated; far standstill.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20091
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned far laterally and with no collision path aligned.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Static status, no trajectory overlap.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20094
- **Distance Risk reason**: Far moved, no path convergence; different segment.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: No movement result expected; safely stationed.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Summary in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

In the current analysis, none of the obstacles pose a measurable risk due to their distance and lack of movement. Consequently, no extreme or collision risk is identified.
