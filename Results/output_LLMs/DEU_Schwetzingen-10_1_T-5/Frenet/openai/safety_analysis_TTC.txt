To evaluate the provided scenario, we will analyze each obstacle according to the given parameters, calculate the Time to Collision (TTC), the Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC), and determine risk scores based on these metrics.

### Calculation Definitions:
- **Time to Collision (TTC)**:
  - For longitudinal direction: \( \text{TTC}_{long} = \frac{\text{DTClong}}{Vrel_{long}} \)
  - For lateral direction: \( \text{TTC}_{lat} = \frac{\text{DTClat}}{Vrel_{lat}} \)

Given that most relative velocities are 0.0 m/s (indicating no movement towards the ego vehicle for many obstacles), we will see a couple of notable exceptions (obstacle 20130). We will handle these computations carefully because a TTC would be undefined or infinite for relative velocities of 0.0 m/s.

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
  - The overall risk can be identified by taking the smallest longitudinal and lateral distances and analyzing them.

Given that much of the data suggests stationary obstacles, we will proceed by evaluating:

### Safety analysis for timestep 6.5 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Obstacle Analysis:**

**- Obstacle ID: 20071.0**  
- Distance Risk reason: The small longitudinal distance (2.1 m) presents a higher risk.  
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)  
- Time Risk reason: Both Vrel_long and Vrel_lat are 0 m/s; thus, any positive distance represents potential collision imminence.  
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)  
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)  

**- Obstacle ID: 20072.0**  
- Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance (3.32 m) indicates a significant risk of collision.  
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)  
- Time Risk reason: Similar to above, the lack of relative motion suggests imminent collision risk.  
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)  
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)  

**- Obstacle ID: 20074.0**  
- Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance (4.35 m) continues to present a risk.  
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)  
- Time Risk reason: No relative motion, hence collision risk is present.  
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)  
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)  

**- Obstacle ID: 20077.0**  
- Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance of 5.36 m still carries extreme risk.  
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)  
- Time Risk reason: Again, with no relative motion, the risk remains.  
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)  
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)  

**- Obstacle ID: 20078.0**  
- Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance of 6.76 m indicates high risk.  
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)  
- Time Risk reason: Lack of relative motion compounding risk.  
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)  
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)  

**- Obstacle ID: 20088.0**  
- Distance Risk reason: At 39.29 m laterally and 0 longitudinally, presents extreme risk.  
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)  
- Time Risk reason: Zero relative motion suggests collision is inevitable.  
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)  
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)  

**- Obstacle ID: 20130.0**  
- Distance Risk reason: Exact coordinate positioning indicates an immediate collision.  
- Distance safety score: 0 (Collision)  
- Time Risk reason: The ego vehicle is at risk of immediate collision.  
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)  
- Overall Risk score: 0 (Collision)  

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20130.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20071.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
```

### Conclusion
A careful analysis shows that multiple obstacles present an extreme risk of collision, necessitating quick reactions from the autonomous vehicle. Obstacle ID 20130 signifies an imminent collision, categorizing this scenario at a critical safety risk level.
