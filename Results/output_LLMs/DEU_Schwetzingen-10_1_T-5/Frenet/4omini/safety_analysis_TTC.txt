### Safety analysis for timestep 6.5: 
Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 20071.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 2.1 m and lateral distance is 4.39 m. This obstacle is very close to the ego car.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Since there is no relative velocity, the Time to Collision is essentially undetermined but suggests an imminent risk because of the proximity.
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 20072.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 3.32 m and lateral distance is 11.47 m, indicating a close position to the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: There is no relative motion, indicating an imminent collision condition.
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 20074.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is 4.35 m and lateral distance is 18.37 m.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: As with others, there is no distance closing but significant proximity.
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 20077.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of 5.36 m and lateral distance of 25.28 m.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Proximity suggests potential for a collision.
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 20078.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal: 6.76 m, Lateral: 32.11 m.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Same reasoning applies as previous.
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID: 20082.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal is 8.8 m and lateral is 38.77 m.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Again, no relative movement, but still in proximity for possible scenarios.
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

7. **Obstacle ID: 20086.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is 14.92 m and lateral is 49.99 m.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Similar observation as above, manageable situation.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

8. **Obstacle ID: 20088.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Exact longitudinal alignment with the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: No motion indicates imminent collision.
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

9. **Obstacle ID: 20130.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Exact alignment with the ego car.
   - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Presence of relative velocity indicates motion towards the ego vehicle.
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

10. **Obstacle ID: 20131.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is -13.71 m and lateral distance is 3.41 m (behind).
    - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
    - **Time Risk reason**: Non-zero relative velocity towards the ego vehicle.
    - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20071.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
```

### Overall Findings:
- Multiple obstacles show immediate and extreme risk levels, particularly those within very close distances.
- Continuous vigilance and prompt maneuvers from the ego vehicle are required to avoid imminent collisions.
