### Safety analysis for timestep 6.5s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* **TTC Calculation:** Since relative velocity and acceleration are provided, a simplified TTC calculation is used: `TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity`. If the relative velocity is zero and the distance is decreasing (obstacle moving towards ego), TTC is considered very small, approaching zero, indicating high risk. If relative velocity is zero and distance is static or increasing, TTC is considered infinite (no collision risk).
* **MDC Calculation:** In this scenario, the provided distances (DTClong, DTClat) are considered representative of the minimum distances since no trajectory information is available to predict future closer approaches.  MDC is calculated as the Euclidean distance:  `sqrt(DTClong^2 + DTClat^2)`.
* **Overall Risk Score:** Determined by the lower of the Distance and Time safety scores, prioritizing the more immediate danger.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 20071.0
- Distance Risk reason: Very close longitudinally (2.1m) and laterally (4.39m) in the front-left.

- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 20072.0
- Distance Risk reason: Close longitudinally (3.32m) but further laterally (11.47m) in the front-left.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity is zero, but the obstacle is driving towards the ego car longitudinally.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 20074.0, 20077.0, 20078.0, 20082.0, 20086.0, 20091.0, 20101.0, 20102.0, 20103.0, 20105.0, 20107.0, 20109.0, 20114.0
