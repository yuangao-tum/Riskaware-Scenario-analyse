### Safety analysis for timestep 6.5 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 20071.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Very close proximity in the longitudinal direction (2.1 m) and moderate in the lateral direction (4.39 m). Stationary relative movement indicates imminent potential collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2
  - **Time Risk reason**: Zero relative velocity implies a static scenario; however, due to point-blank distance, corrective speed adjustments are urgent.
  - **Time safety score**: 1
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 20072.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Close proximity longitudinally (3.32 m) with lateral distance (11.47 m). The lack of relative motion indicates potential collision risk remains high.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: No relative motion suggests zero TTC; proactive measures are necessary to avoid collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 2
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 20073.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Increasing longitudinal distance (4.35 m) but still risk-prone due to stationary setting.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Stationary obstacle indicates no TTC improvement without intervention.
  - **Time safety score**: 2
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 20130.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Zero distance in both longitudinal and lateral directions poses an immediate collision situation.
  - **Distance safety score**: 0
  - **Time Risk reason**: Relative motion velocity indicates existing collision event requiring immediate stop or adjustment, indicating TTC of zero.
  - **Time safety score**: 0
  - **Overall Risk score**: 0

### Summary in JSON Format
