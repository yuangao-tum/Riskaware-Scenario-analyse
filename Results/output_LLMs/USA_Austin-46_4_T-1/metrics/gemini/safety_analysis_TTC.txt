Safety analysis for timestep 6.4 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 6.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3277
- Relative Direction: Front
- Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle poses an extreme risk longitudinally (DTClong = 0.27m) and a collision risk laterally (DTClat = 0.0m) due to its close proximity to the ego vehicle. Since the relative direction is front, the longitudinal distance is dominant.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0
- Time Risk Reason: The obstacle presents a medium risk longitudinally (TTClong = 2.99s).  The lateral time to collision is not applicable in this scenario as DTClat is zero.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 3.0
- Overall Risk Score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 3278
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle poses no risk both longitudinally (DTClong = 10.15m) and laterally (DTClat = 12.19m) as it maintains a safe distance from the ego vehicle.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
- Time Risk Reason: The obstacle demonstrates no risk both longitudinally (TTClong = 114.57s) and laterally (TTClat = Infinity). The high TTC values signify ample time for the ego vehicle to react.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
- Overall Risk Score: 5
