Safety analysis for timestep 6.4 seconds:
``` 
### Safety analysis for timestep 6.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 3277
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: Both DTClong (0.27) and DTClat (0.0) values indicate extreme risk as the obstacle is very close longitudinally and laterally aligned or unknown. 
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1  
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong (2.99) at medium risk and TTClat (0.0) indicating collision along the lateral direction.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 3
    - Overall Risk Score: 2

### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 3278
    - Relative Direction: Front-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: Both DTClong (10.15) and DTClat (12.19) values indicate negligible risk as the obstacle is far away in both directions.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong (114.57) and TTClat (Infinity) values indicate negligible risk as collision is not likely to occur soon enough.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Risk Score: 5
