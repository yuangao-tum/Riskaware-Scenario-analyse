Safety analysis for timestep 6.4 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 6.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3277
- Relative Direction: Front
- Distance Risk Reason: The longitudinal distance to collision is 0.27, which is very close to the ego vehicle, indicating a high likelihood of collision. The lateral distance is 0.0; therefore, it confirms a direct alignment on the path to the collision.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 1
- Time Risk Reason: The longitudinal time to collision is 2.99 seconds, which offers some time to react, but the lateral time is 0.0, suggesting immediate danger. The primary concern remains the longitudinal threat.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 2
- Overall Risk Score: 1

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3278
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: The longitudinal distance to collision is 10.15, which poses a low threat, whereas the lateral distance is significant at 12.19, indicating no immediate risk of collision.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
- Time Risk Reason: The longitudinal time to collision is 114.57, and the lateral time is infinite, indicating that the obstacle poses no actual threat to the ego vehicle.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Risk Score: 5
