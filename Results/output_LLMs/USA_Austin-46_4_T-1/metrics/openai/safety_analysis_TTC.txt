Safety analysis for timestep 6.4 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 6.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 3277
- **Relative Direction:** Front
- **Distance Risk Reason:** The longitudinal distance to collision is 0.27, which is within the range for extreme risk, while the lateral distance is 0.0, indicating that the obstacle is directly in line. This presents a serious risk as the vehicle is potentially on a collision course.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 1  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 0  
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** DSC = 1 * 1 + 0 * (1-1) = 1   
- **Time Risk Reason:** The longitudinal time to collision is 2.99, which is in the medium-risk range where timely reactions are necessary, and the lateral time is 0.0, indicating an immediate path to collision.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 3  
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 0  
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** TSC = 3 * 1 + 0 * (1-1) = 3  
- **Overall Risk Score:** Risk Score = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 3 = 2.0 (rounded down to 2)

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 3278
- **Relative Direction:** Front-left
- **Distance Risk Reason:** The longitudinal distance to collision is 10.15, which poses negligible risk, while the lateral distance is 12.19 also indicating a negligible risk factor. Thus, there is no immediate collision risk with this obstacle.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 5  
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** DSC = 5 * 0.5 + 5 * (1-0.5) = 5   
- **Time Risk Reason:** The longitudinal time to collision is 114.57, which is a negligible risk score. Lateral time is infinity, reinforcing that this scenario presents no significant risk of collision.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 5  
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** TSC = 5 * 0.5 + 5 * (1-0.5) = 5  
- **Overall Risk Score:** Risk Score = 0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 5 = 5.0 (rounded down to 5)
