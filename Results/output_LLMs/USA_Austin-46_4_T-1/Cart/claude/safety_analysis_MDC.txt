Safety analysis for the last timestep (6.4 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario and provide a safety assessment.

### Safety Analysis:

For Obstacle ID 3277.0 (Same lanelet 605.0 as ego):
- Initial distance between ego and obstacle is ~11.5m
- Initially moving slower than ego, then stops
- Maintains safe separation throughout scenario
- Distance Risk reason: Adequate longitudinal separation, same lanelet but stable distance
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: No convergence in trajectories, obstacle stops completely
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

For Obstacle ID 3278.0 (Different lanelet 340.0):
- Located in a different lanelet
- Significant lateral separation
- Moving in different direction
- Distance Risk reason: Large lateral separation, different trajectory
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: No intersection of paths, different lanelets
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Key Observations:
1. The ego vehicle decelerates from ~6 m/s to near stop
2. Obstacle 3277 stops completely while maintaining safe distance
3. Obstacle 3278 is in a different lanelet with no path intersection

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

There are no collision (score 0) or extreme risk (score 1) obstacles in this scenario. Both obstacles maintain safe distances and have stable trajectories relative to the ego vehicle. The ego vehicle's controlled deceleration and the stopping of obstacle 3277 contribute to maintaining safety throughout the scenario.
