Safety analysis for the last timestep (6.4 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 6.4: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 3277.0:
- **Proximity Analysis:**
  - **Same lanelet**: Yes, in lanelet 605.0 along with the ego vehicle.
  - **Longitudinal and lateral distances**:
    - The ego vehicle at position (-468.73, 21.9653) and obstacle at position (-473.2468, 23.5096) yields approximately -4.52 meters longitudinally and -1.54 meters laterally.
- **Distance Risk reason:** 
  - **DTClong**: Short negative distance indicates potential overlap or very close proximity in orientation.
  - **DTClat**: Moderate lateral offset.
- **Distance safety score:** 1, due to longitudinal proximity indicating immediate risk.
  
- **Time to Collision Analysis:**
  - Since the ego vehicle is moving slowly (0.0886 m/s) compared to the stationary obstacle, and considering negative longitudinal distance, TTC long would pretty much be immediate or extremely short.
  - **TTClat** won't significantly differ due to the current low speeds and stationarity of both entities.
- **Time Risk reason:**
  - **TTClong**: Very high immediacy of potential collision given short distances and ego's forward motion albeit slow.
  - **TTClat**: Effectively neutral due to low speed and stationary obstacle.
- **Time safety score:** 1, reflecting high urgency and immediacy.
  
- **Overall Risk score:** 1, classified as <Extreme Risk> due to immediate threat for collision.

#### Obstacle 3278.0:
- **Proximity Analysis:**
  - **Different lanelet**: In lanelet 340.0, not in immediate trajectory of the ego vehicle.
  - **Longitudinal and lateral distances**:
    - The ego vehicle at position (-468.73, 21.9653) and obstacle at position (-486.9494, 13.4028) results in approximately -18.22 meters longitudinally and 8.56 meters laterally.
- **Distance Risk reason:** 
  - **DTClong**: Substantial distance long ensures no immediate risk.
  - **DTClat**: Sufficient lateral distance maintains safe gap.
- **Distance safety score:** 5, due to safe distancing and different lane aligning.

- **Time to Collision Analysis:**
  - Obstacles remain stationary. Given the yaw angle and lateral displacement, plus greater longitudinal difference, there's no immediate collision path.
- **Time Risk reason:**
  - **TTClong & TTClat**: N/A functionally due to different lanes and safe distances.
- **Time safety score:** 5, reinforcing negligible collision potential.
  
- **Overall Risk score:** 5, marked as <Negligible Risk> given substantial safety buffers and absence of collision course.

### Summary in JSON Format: 

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3277.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

Through this analysis, we determine that the immediate concern lies with obstacle 3277.0, situated in the ego vehicle's lane, bearing a high immediacy for collision, requiring swift corrective action.
