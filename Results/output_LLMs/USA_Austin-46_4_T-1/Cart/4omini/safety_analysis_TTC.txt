Safety analysis for the last timestep (6.4 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 6.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

The ego vehicle and obstacles need to be analyzed for collision risk based on their positions, velocities, and trajectories.

- **Ego Vehicle:**
    - Position: (-468.73, 21.9653)
    - Velocity: 0.0886 m/s (moving very slowly and decelerating)
    - Lanelet: 605.0

- **Obstacle 3277.0:**
    - Position: (-473.2468, 23.5096)
    - Velocity: 0.0 m/s (stationary)
    - Lanelet: 605.0

- **Obstacle 3278.0:**
    - Position: (-486.9494, 13.4028)
    - Velocity: 0.0 m/s (stationary)
    - Lanelet: 340.0 (not in the same lanelet)

### Obstacle Analysis:

**Obstacle ID: 3277.0**

1. **Distance Metrics:**
   - **Longitudinal Distance (x-axis):** Between the ego vehicle (-468.73) and obstacle 3277.0 (-473.2468) = |(-468.73 - (-473.2468))| = 4.5168 meters
   - **Lateral Distance (y-axis):** Between the ego vehicle (21.9653) and obstacle 3277.0 (23.5096) = |(21.9653 - 23.5096)| = 1.5443 meters
   - **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):** Hypothetical collision point would involve both longitudinal and lateral distances. The total distance using the Pythagorean theorem is:
     \[
     MDC = \sqrt{(4.5168^2 + 1.5443^2)} \approx \sqrt{(20.3678 + 2.3864)} \approx \sqrt{22.7542} \approx 4.77 \text{ meters}
     \]

2. **Time Metrics:**
   - **Relative Velocity:** The ego vehicle is moving at 0.0886 m/s towards the stationary obstacle while it is almost stationary itself.
   - **Time to Collision (TTC):**
     \[
     TTC = \frac{MDC}{Relative \ Velocity} = \frac{4.77}{0.0886} \approx 53.9 \text{ seconds}
     \]

3. **Risk Analysis:**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The MDC of 4.77 meters indicates a safe distance, allowing for proper reactions.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** A TTC of approximately 53.9 seconds indicates there is ample time to react, as there is no imminent threat.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** Minimum of distance score and time score = 4 (Low Risk)

**Obstacle ID: 3278.0**
- Not in the same lanelet, therefore no direct collision risk.

### Summary in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
``` 

### Overall Remarks:
- The analysis shows that the ego vehicle is only at risk from obstacle 3277.0 with an overall low risk score. The other obstacle is not considered a threat due to its location in a different lanelet.
