Safety analysis for the last timestep (6.4 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 6.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3277.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3277.0 is in the same lanelet (605.0) as the ego vehicle and very close.  Lateral distance is small and longitudinal distance is also small indicating a high risk of collision.  The obstacle is stationary, while the ego vehicle is moving slowly, but decelerating.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Since the obstacle is stationary and in the ego vehicle's path with a low velocity and deceleration, TTC is likely short.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3278.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3278.0 is in a different lanelet (340.0). While the longitudinal distance is greater than to obstacle 3277.0, the lateral distance is relatively small.  This presents a moderate risk, depending on the ego vehicle's future trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Since the obstacle is stationary and the ego vehicle's velocity is low, TTC is likely moderate.  The lateral motion of the ego vehicle needs careful consideration.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)
