### Safety analysis for timestep 6.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3277.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is directly in front of the ego car at a longitudinal distance of 0.27 m and a lateral distance of 0.0 m. This close proximity represents an immediate threat of collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk) - The very short distance indicates an urgent need for action to avoid collision.
  - **Time Risk reason**: With a relative longitudinal velocity of -0.09 m/s (the obstacle approaches the ego vehicle) and nearly zero relative velocity laterally, the Time to Collision (TTC) is extremely short.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk) - The negligible TTC indicates an immediate collision risk.
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3278.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at the front-left with a longitudinal distance of 10.15 m and lateral distance of 12.19 m, this obstacle is further from the ego car, offering more maneuvering space.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk) - There is minimal immediate collision risk due to the greater separation.
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative longitudinal velocity of -0.09 m/s suggests the obstacle is also slowly approaching the ego vehicle, but given the significant initial distance, TTC is not an immediate concern.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk) - The TTC is manageable with ample time to react.
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)
