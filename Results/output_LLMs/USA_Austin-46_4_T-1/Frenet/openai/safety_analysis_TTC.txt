### Safety analysis for timestep 6.4: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 3277.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is at a longitudinal distance of 0.27 m, which is very close to the ego vehicle. Lateral distance is 0.0 m, indicating they are perfectly aligned. This situation presents a very high risk of imminent collision.
  - **Distance safety score:** **1** (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The relative longitudinal velocity is -0.09 m/s, indicating the obstacle is approaching, resulting in a Time to Collision (TTC longitudinal) of \(TTC_{long} = \frac{0.27 m}{0.09 m/s} = 3.0 s\). There is no lateral relative velocity, but alignment means any advance will lead to collision. Thus, the collision is likely.
  - **Time safety score:** **3** (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** **1** (because of the extreme proximity and imminent collision)

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 3278.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance is 10.15 m and lateral distance is 12.19 m. Although the relative velocity is -0.09 m/s, the distances are significant enough that there is no immediate risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** **4** (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The longitudinal TTC is \(TTC_{long} = \frac{10.15 m}{0.09 m/s} â‰ˆ 112.78 s\). The considerable distance suggests low risk of collision event; hence, it gives ample time to react.
  - **Time safety score:** **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** **4** (This indicates that there is very low risk due to considerable distances even though the object is still longitudinally approaching.)

### Summary in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3277.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

### Detailed Conclusion:
- Obstacle 3277.0 poses an immediate concern due to its close proximity and the trajectory leading to collision, resulting in an overall extreme risk score. 
- Obstacle 3278.0, while still moving forward, is at a manageable distance which allows for sufficient reaction time to avoid collision, leading to a low-risk status overall.
