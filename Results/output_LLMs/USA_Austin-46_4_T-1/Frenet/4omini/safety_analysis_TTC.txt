### Safety analysis for timestep 6.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 3277.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance between the ego vehicle and Obstacle 3277.0 is very short at 0.27 m, with a lateral distance of 0.0 m indicating a direct alignment. Since the obstacle is moving toward the ego vehicle with a longitudinal relative velocity of -0.09 m/s, it is crucial to consider this imminent closeness.
- **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk) – Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.

- **Time Risk reason**: Given a longitudinal distance of 0.27 m and a relative longitudinal velocity of -0.09 m/s, the Time to Collision (TTC) can be calculated as TTC = Distance / Velocity = 0.27 m / 0.09 m/s = 3.0 seconds. This indicates there is some time to react, but given the very short distance, it is concerning.
- **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk) – Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick maneuvering.

- **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk) – Since the distance score is 1 and poses immediate risk.

#### Obstacle 3278.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance to Obstacle 3278.0 is 10.15 m, with a lateral distance of 12.19 m. The large distance between the ego vehicle and this obstacle suggests that there is ample space, despite the obstacle moving toward the ego vehicle. 
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk) – Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.

- **Time Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance of 10.15 m and relative velocity of -0.09 m/s gives a TTC = 10.15 m / 0.09 m/s = 112.78 seconds. This is a considerable amount of time, indicating that there is a low likelihood of immediate collision if managed properly.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk) – No significant collision risk. 

- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk) – The overall risk score reflects greater safety due to the adequate distance and time to react. 

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3277.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, Obstacle 3277.0 presents an immediate collision risk due to its proximity and movement toward the ego vehicle, requiring urgent action. Obstacle 3278.0 is much safer, indicating no significant risk of collision with ample distance and time. Overall, the scenario highlights urgent attention to the first obstacle.
