### Safety analysis for timestep 6.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3277.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3277.0 is extremely close to the ego vehicle longitudinally (0.27m) and directly in front (0m lateral). This indicates an extremely high risk of immediate collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason:  The small negative longitudinal velocity (-0.09 m/s) suggests the obstacle might be approaching slightly slower than the ego vehicle if the ego vehicle is stationary, or moving slightly towards the ego vehicle while the ego vehicle is moving forward, though the relative acceleration would suggest that the ego vehicle is braking.  In either case, given the minuscule distance, a collision is imminent. 
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 3278.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3278.0 is at a safe longitudinal (10.15m) and lateral (12.19m) distance from the ego vehicle. This poses no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The negative longitudinal velocity (-0.09 m/s) suggests a slight closing of the distance, but given the current separation, it doesn't pose a significant risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
