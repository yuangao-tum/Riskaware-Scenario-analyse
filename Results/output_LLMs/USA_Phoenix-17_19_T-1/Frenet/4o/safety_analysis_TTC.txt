### Safety analysis for timestep 11.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 3655.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is in the front-right, moving away in both longitudinal (13.77 m) and lateral directions (-3.5 m); hence, minimal immediate risk.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Positive relative velocity (5.91 m/s longitudinal) indicates the obstacle is moving away; negligible collision risk.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3656.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Front-left position with relatively close longitudinal distance (6.82 m). Stationary or slight approach raises slight concern.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3
- **Time Risk Reason**: Negative longitudinal velocity (-1.75 m/s), indicating approach to ego in the front-left quadrant with moderate caution required.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 3657.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Lateral position (right) distance of -5.46 m with 0 longitudinal distance shows alignment but not a direct collision path.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Longitudinal velocity (-1.75 m/s), indicating no direct collision trajectory; managed risk.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 3658.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Front-right at 14.22 m longitudinally; moving away reduces risk.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Positive longitudinal velocity (5.74 m/s), continues moving away, low risk.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3659.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Front-left with a cautious distance (11.64 m longitudinal); needs monitoring due to lateral approach.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3
- **Time Risk Reason**: Positive velocity indicates moving away longitudinally but lateral approach (4.67 m/s) from left needs attention.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 3660.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Front-left with 10.32 m longitudinal distance; stationary with respect to lateral motion presents little risk.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Longitudinal approach (-1.75 m/s) indicates focus required but manageable risk level for current distance.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 3661.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned front-left with safe longitudinal distance (13.83 m).
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Longitudinal velocity (-1.75 m/s) towards indicates caution but no immediate collision risk.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 3662.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Front-right with 1.37 m longitudinal distance; moving away longitudinally and laterally, low risk.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Moving away at longitudinal velocity (4.52 m/s) reduces risk level.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3663.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: In front-left, safe longitudinal distance at 17.33 m, with no lateral approach.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Longitudinal approach (-1.75 m/s) but manageable due to distance.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 3664.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Far in front-left (20.83 m), reducing collision risk significantly.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 
- **Time Risk Reason**: Longitudinal approach (-1.75 m/s), but low risk due to formidable distance and absence of lateral motion.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3666.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Left side at moderate proximity (1.78 m laterally); stationary but needs attention.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3 
- **Time Risk Reason**: A relative velocity of 3.63 m/s indicates lateral movement towards the ego car; thus vigilance is required.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 3667.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Negligible distance in the rear; motion towards ego presents significant risk.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 1 
- **Time Risk Reason**: Collision highly likely, given the immediate proximity and velocity towards ego.
- **Time Safety Score**: 1
- **Overall Risk Score**: 1

#### Obstacle ID: 3668.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Rear-right with negative longitudinal distance (-0.86 m) and moving towards the ego car calls for immediate caution.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 1 
- **Time Risk Reason**: High longitudinal approach (3.25 m/s), high risk of collision.
- **Time Safety Score**: 1
- **Overall Risk Score**: 1

#### Obstacle ID: 3669.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Rear-right with insignificant distance and minimal risk due to lateral motion away.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4 
- **Time Risk Reason**: Longitudinally away, low collision risk.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4
