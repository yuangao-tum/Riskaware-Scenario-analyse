### Safety analysis for timestep 11.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3655.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 13.77 m longitudinally and -3.5 m laterally away and moving away from the ego vehicle. This distance is relatively safe in both dimensions.
  - Distance safety score: **4**
  - Time Risk reason: With a relative longitudinal velocity of 5.91 m/s, the Time to Collision (TTC) is approximately 13.77 / 5.91 ≈ 2.33 seconds, which is manageable. Lateral TTC is not of concern due to the moving away status.
  - Time safety score: **4**
  - Overall Risk score: **4**

- **Obstacle ID: 3656.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 6.82 m longitudinally and 9.11 m laterally away, and it is moving toward the ego vehicle. Longitudinally, it is closer than desired.
  - Distance safety score: **3**
  - Time Risk reason: The longitudinal relative velocity is -1.75 m/s. TTC longitudinally is 6.82 / (-1.75) ≈ 3.89 seconds (negative, indicating approach). Lateral distance is adequate, however.
  - Time safety score: **3**
  - Overall Risk score: **3**

- **Obstacle ID: 3657.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: At 0.0 m longitudinally and -5.46 m laterally, the obstacle is at the point of potential collision, presenting a very high risk.
  - Distance safety score: **1**
  - Time Risk reason: With longitudinal velocity of -1.75 m/s, TTC longitudinally is 0.0 / (-1.75) = 0 seconds, indicating an immediate collision is pending.
  - Time safety score: **1**
  - Overall Risk score: **1**

- **Obstacle ID: 3658.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 14.22 m longitudinally and -0.06 m laterally away and is moving away. Thus, it is relatively safe.
  - Distance safety score: **4**
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC is 14.22 / 5.74 ≈ 2.48 seconds, which is manageable.
  - Time safety score: **4**
  - Overall Risk score: **4**

- **Obstacle ID: 3659.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 11.64 m longitudinally away and 0.66 m laterally but is moving toward the ego vehicle laterally.
  - Distance safety score: **3**
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinally with -1.75 m/s, TTC is 11.64 / (-1.75) ≈ 6.65 seconds (negative). Lateral distance is manageable, but longitudinal distance is concerning.
  - Time safety score: **3**
  - Overall Risk score: **3**

- **Obstacle ID: 3660.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 10.32 m longitudinally and 9.0 m laterally away, moving toward the ego vehicle. Longitudinal concern exists here.
  - Distance safety score: **3**
  - Time Risk reason: With a longitudinal speed of -1.75 m/s, TTC longitudinally is 10.32 / (-1.75) ≈ 5.89 seconds (negative).
  - Time safety score: **3**
  - Overall Risk score: **3**

- **Obstacle ID: 3661.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 13.83 m longitudinally and 8.9 m laterally away and moving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally only.
  - Distance safety score: **4**
  - Time Risk reason: Here as well, with -1.75 m/s, TTC is 13.83 / (-1.75) ≈ 7.91 seconds (negative).
  - Time safety score: **3**
  - Overall Risk score: **3**

- **Obstacle ID: 3662.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is very close at 1.37 m longitudinally and -2.06 m laterally away, moving away. High risk.
  - Distance safety score: **2**
  - Time Risk reason: With 4.52 m/s, longitudinal TTC is 1.37 / 4.52 ≈ 0.30 seconds, indicating potential immediate collision risk.
  - Time safety score: **2**
  - Overall Risk score: **2**

- **Obstacle ID: 3663.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 17.33 m longitudinally and 8.79 m laterally away, moving towards the ego vehicle. Generally a safe distance.
  - Distance safety score: **4**
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinally, with -1.75 m/s, the TTC is 17.33 / (-1.75) ≈ 9.90 seconds (negative).
  - Time safety score: **4**
  - Overall Risk score: **4**

- **Obstacle ID: 3664.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: It is 20.83 m longitudinally and 8.69 m laterally away and still moving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally.
  - Distance safety score: **4**
  - Time Risk reason: TTC longitudinally is around 20.83 / (-1.75) ≈ 11.88 seconds (negative). 
  - Time safety score: **4**
  - Overall Risk score: **4**

- **Obstacle ID: 3666.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is at 0.0 m longitudinally and 1.78 m laterally indicating close proximity.
  - Distance safety score: **1**
  - Time Risk reason: With 3.63 m/s, longitudinal TTC is 0.0 / (3.63) = 0 seconds, indicating an immediate collision risk.
  - Time safety score: **1**
  - Overall Risk score: **1**

- **Obstacle ID: 3667.0**
