### Safety analysis for timestep 11.6: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 3655.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively far away (13.77m longitudinal, -3.5m lateral) and moving away both longitudinally and laterally. Located front-right.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away, no TTC.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 3656.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close (6.82m longitudinal, 9.11m lateral) and approaching longitudinally while lateral velocity is zero. Located front-left.  Needs monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 3

- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 3659.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately far (11.64m longitudinal, 0.66m lateral) and moving away longitudinally but approaching laterally. Front-left location.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, but lateral approach needs monitoring.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 3660.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately far (10.32m longitudinal, 9.0m lateral) but approaching longitudinally. Located front-left.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (TTC ~ 5.9s based on 10.32m/1.75m/s), no lateral movement.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 3661.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Far (13.83m longitudinal, 8.9m lateral) but approaching longitudinally. Located front-left.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (TTC ~ 7.9s based on 13.83m / 1.75m/s), no lateral movement.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 3662.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Very close (1.37m longitudinal, -2.06m lateral) but moving away, primarily longitudinally. Front-right.
- Distance safety score: 2

- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 3663.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Far (17.33m longitudinal, 8.79m lateral) but approaching longitudinally. Front-left.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (TTC ~ 9.9s based on 17.33m/1.75m/s), no lateral movement.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
