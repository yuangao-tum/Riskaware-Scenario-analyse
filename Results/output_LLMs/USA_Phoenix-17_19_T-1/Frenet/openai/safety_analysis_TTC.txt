To evaluate the scenario in question, we will go through each obstacle, calculate the Time to Collision (TTC) in both longitudinal and lateral directions, determine the Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC), and assess the overall risk scores according to the metrics defined.

### Calculations:
1. **Time to Collision (TTC)**:
   - Longitudinal TTC: 
     \[
     TTC_{long} = \frac{DTC_{long}}{V_{rel_{long}}} 
     \]
   - Lateral TTC:
   \[
   TTC_{lat} = \frac{DTC_{lat}}{V_{rel_{lat}}}
   \]
   A negative or zero relative velocity indicates a potential immediate risk.

2. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - The MDC is simply the Euclidean distance calculated as:
   \[
   MDC = \sqrt{DTC_{long}^{2} + DTC_{lat}^{2}}
   \]
