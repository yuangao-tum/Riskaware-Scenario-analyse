Safety analysis for the last timestep (11.6 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 11.6: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3655**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The distance from the ego vehicle is 18.76 meters with both obstacles heading towards the same direction. As both velocities are considerable, potential for closing distance exists.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** Faster relative speed initially but with sufficient lateral clearance. Longitudinal overlap is leading to potential conflict, however manageable due to accelerating ego vehicle.
  - **Time safety score:** 4
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3656**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Standing still on a different lanelet and far enough laterally (approximately 12.4 meters).
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** No velocity, and positioned laterally aligned but non-threatening trajectory since they're on parallel lanes.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3657**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Located 9.57 meters from the ego vehicle but stationary and different lanelet. Collision trajectory unlikely as path diverges.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** Stationary thus almost negligible conflict, maintain broad separation laterally.
  - **Time safety score:** 4
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3658**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** 20.18 meters away, moving in parallel with a similar lateral axis, but distance increase anticipating lower risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** With both accelerating, chances diminish rapidly given similar directional motion.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3659**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** 11.69 meters, with decreasing potential road conflict due to steady paralleling horizontal separation and converging tracks.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** Present but marginal risk due to speed gap, partially converging trajectory, yet controlled via acceleration.
  - **Time safety score:** 4
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3660**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal alignment on alternative lanelet reduces risk due to non-overlapping path.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Zero velocity, hence no intersecting motion with the ego path.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5
  
- **Obstacle ID: 3661**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Similar as above, parallel lanelet position negates impact risk despite closer lateral distance.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** No movement signifies no collision threat contained within occupied parallel space.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3662**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** 6.47 meters away, progressing at moderate speed hence inline risk with predictable control options.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3
  - **Time Risk reason:** Mid-range reactive possibility exists due to velocity, but management feasible through maneuver adjustments.
  - **Time safety score:** 3
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3663**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Standing far away laterally without directional convergence or motion, hence no collision chance.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Zero movement negates immediate path conflict especially with much longitudinal separation.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3664**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Way beyond collision scope due to lateral distance approximately 24 meters.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Complete stationary state minimizes significant threat.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3666**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Moderate approach ahead but planar convergence permits leverage to cushion potential overlap.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3
  - **Time Risk reason:** Time margin improvements evident with balanced navigation through inter-lane offset.
  - **Time safety score:** 3
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3667**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Next lanelet presence with enough lateral separation curtails direct impact likelihood.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** Adjustable space interlaced with velocity conducive to avoiding immediate intersection.
  - **Time safety score:** 4
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3668**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Spread sufficiently over a divergent lanelet, mitigating direct contact risk effectively.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Stable path adherence removes urgency for evasive actions.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3669**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Consistent long-range separation, standing essentially stationary eliminates rising interaction need.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Minimal progress rate results in allaying urgent responses.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5
