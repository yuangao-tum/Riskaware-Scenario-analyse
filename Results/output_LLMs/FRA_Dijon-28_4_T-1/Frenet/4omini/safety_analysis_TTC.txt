### Safety analysis for timestep 2.1: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30529.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The relative longitudinal distance is -24.92 m, indicating the obstacle is behind the ego car, and lateral distance is 0.0 m. The obstacle is approaching from behind.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity is 5.02 m/s. The Time to Collision (TTC) is approximately 4.97 seconds to hit the ego vehicle. However, due to the close proximity, there is a high risk of collision in the near future.
  - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30530.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 2.63 m longitudinally and 4.43 m laterally in front-left, indicating it is approaching rapidly.
  - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: With a relative velocity of -5.09 m/s longitudinally and -6.0 m/s laterally, the collision is highly probable. The TTC calculations show an immediate threat since the obstacle is closing in fast.
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30532.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is currently 0.0 m longitudinally and laterally, indicating a direct overlap or collision course with the ego car.
  - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity of 4.3 m/s suggests an immediate encroachment that indicates a collision, with TTC effectively at 0.
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30533.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: It is 43.5 m behind the ego vehicle, indicating no immediate threat.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity of 7.95 m/s. The obstacle is moving away, resulting in sufficient time to avoid future collisions.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30534.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance of 3.57 m and lateral of 34.1 m suggests it is approaching from the front-left, but still at a safe distance.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative speed indicates that while itâ€™s getting closer, there remains a manageable time to react.
  - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30535.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance of 10.18 m and lateral of -65.65 m suggest it is approaching from the front-right but is still outside immediate strike range.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Relatively slow closing rates in both directions still denote time to react.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30536.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: It's 2.89 m long and 54.98 m lateral on the front-left away from initial collision space.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Approaching slowly too provides ample time to react.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30537.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance is -11.51 m, which is close but manageable.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative speed indicates it is closing from behind but nothing immediate.
  - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30538.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: It is at a distance of 8.59 m longitudinally and -14.67 m laterally.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Moderate closure rate allows some time.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30539.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinally at 8.1 m with a lateral distance of 0.0 m indicates a direct approach.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity poses a notable risk, warranting caution.
  - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)
