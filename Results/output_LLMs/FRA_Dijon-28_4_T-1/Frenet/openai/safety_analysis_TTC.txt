### Safety analysis for timestep 2.1 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30529**
   - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is behind the ego car at a distance of -24.92 m longitudinally. 
   - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk: The obstacle is far enough and moving away from the ego vehicle).
   - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity of 5.02 m/s indicates it's moving towards the ego car but at a safe distance (TTC = 24.92 / 5.02 = 4.95 seconds).
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk: More than 4 seconds of time to collision).
   - Overall Risk score: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 30530**
   - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is very close at 2.63 m longitudinally and 4.43 m laterally, moving toward the ego car.
   - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk: Very close proximity could lead to a collision).
   - Time Risk reason: TTC calculation yields 0.52 seconds, indicating a very high likelihood of an impact soon.
   - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk: Immediate collision risk).
   - Overall Risk score: 1

3. **Obstacle ID: 30532**
   - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is exactly at 0.0 m longitudinally and laterally, meaning it's already in contact or colliding with the ego car.
   - Distance safety score: 0 (Collision: Immediate impact).
   - Time Risk reason: As it's in collision, TTC is irrelevant, as the collision is already occurring.
   - Time safety score: 0 (Collision: Immediate risk).
   - Overall Risk score: 0

4. **Obstacle ID: 30533**
   - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is at -43.5 m behind the ego car, moving toward it.
   - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk: Far enough not to interfere).
   - Time Risk reason: TTC = 43.5 / 7.95 = 5.47 seconds.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk).
   - Overall Risk score: 5

5. **Obstacle ID: 30534**
   - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle at 3.57 m longitudinally and 34.1 m laterally is moving toward the ego car from the left.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk: Approaching but manageable).
   - Time Risk reason: TTC = 3.57 / 12.58 = 0.28 seconds (very close).
   - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk: very close to a potential impact).
   - Overall Risk score: 1

6. **Obstacle ID: 30535**
   - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is at 10.18 m longitudinally and moving towards the ego car.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk: enough distance to react).
   - Time Risk reason: TTC = 10.18 / 8.94 = 1.14 seconds (potential collision).
   - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk).
   - Overall Risk score: 2

7. **Obstacle ID: 30536**
   - Distance Risk reason: At 2.89 m longitudinally and 54.98 m laterally, this obstacle is moving away.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk: still some distance).
   - Time Risk reason: TTC = 2.89 / 12.86 = 0.22 seconds showing high risks approaching.
   - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk).
   - Overall Risk score: 1

8. **Obstacle ID: 30537**
   - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is at -11.51 m behind the ego car.
   - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk).
   - Time Risk reason: TTC = 11.51 / 3.98 = 2.89 seconds.
   - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk).
   - Overall Risk score: 4

9. **Obstacle ID: 30538**
   - Distance Risk reason: Positioned at 8.59 m longitudinally and -14.67 m laterally, approaching from the right.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk: more than 8 m distance).
   - Time Risk reason: TTC = 8.59 / 6.23 = 1.38 seconds.
   - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk).
   - Overall Risk score: 2

10. **Obstacle ID: 30539**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located at 8.1 m longitudinally with 0 m laterally; moving towards the ego car.
    - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk).
    - Time Risk reason: TTC = 8.1 / 5.48 = 1.48 seconds.
    - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk).
    - Overall Risk score: 2
