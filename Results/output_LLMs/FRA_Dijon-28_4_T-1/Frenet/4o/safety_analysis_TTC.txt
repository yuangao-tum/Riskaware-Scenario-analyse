### Safety Analysis for Timestep 2.1: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30529.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of -24.92m. Given its behind position, it poses minimal immediate risk.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
  - **Time Risk Reason**: The relative velocity is 5.02 m/s towards the ego, leading to an increasing distance. The TTC is not immediately concerning.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30530.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: In the front-left position with close proximity (2.63m longitudinally), and moving towards the ego laterally.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 3
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Negative relative velocities suggest a collision path with TTC estimated at a short duration due to proximity.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 2
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30532.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Directly at a 0.0m distance longitudinally and laterally indicates immediate collision.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 0
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Immediate collision as indicated by the zero distances.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 0
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 30533.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle at -43.5m, indicating no immediate threat.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Relative velocity of 7.95 m/s is away, resulting in increasing separation.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30534.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: At a moderate diagonal distance (3.57m longitudinal, 34.1m lateral).
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Relative motion indicates lateral movement toward ego, but longitudinal movement is minimal, allowing time for maneuver.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30535.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Located front-right at a significant lateral distance (-65.65m) and safe longitudinally (10.18m).
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Negative lateral velocity suggests closing laterally, but safe for the time being.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30536.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned front-left at a safe distance (2.89m longitudinal, 54.98m lateral).
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Lateral movement toward the ego is evident, but due to distance, immediate risk is low.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30537.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned behind (-11.51m), indicating some risk due to the relatively close distance.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Approaching with a relative velocity of 3.98 m/s, but distance allows reaction time.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30538.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Front-right position (8.59m longitudinal, -14.67m lateral) poses low risk.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Lateral velocity indicated movement toward, but safe due to distance.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30539.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Front alignment with proximity (8.1m longitudinal) suggests caution, but not immediate.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Low longitudinal velocity toward ego indicates low TTC risk.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 3
