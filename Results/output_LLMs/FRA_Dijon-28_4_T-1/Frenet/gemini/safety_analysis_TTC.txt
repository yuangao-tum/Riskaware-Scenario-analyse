### Safety analysis for timestep 2.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30529.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind the ego vehicle at -24.92m longitudinal distance. No immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Approaching from behind at 5.02 m/s, but with ample distance, no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30530.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively close at 2.63m longitudinal and 4.43m lateral distance. Poses a potential risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Closing velocities (-5.09 m/s longitudinal, -6.0 m/s lateral) suggest a high probability of near-future collision if no action is taken.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30532.0**
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.0m longitudinal and 0.0m lateral distance. Collision is imminent.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason:  Collision is happening.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 30533.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind the ego vehicle at a safe distance of -43.5m.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Approaching at 7.95 m/s, but the distance provides a sufficient buffer.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30534.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Laterally far (34.1m) but longitudinally close (3.57m).
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally (0.19 m/s) but approaching laterally at a high speed (-12.58 m/s). Requires attention.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30535.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far at 10.18m longitudinal and -65.65m lateral distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Slight longitudinal closing velocity (-0.39 m/s) and lateral closing velocity (8.94 m/s) might become concerning later but not an immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30536.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Longitudinally close (2.89m) but laterally far (54.98m).
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally (1.05 m/s) and approaching laterally at -12.86 m/s. Needs monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


- **Obstacle ID: 30537.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively close at -11.51m longitudinal distance and approaching from behind.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Closing velocity of 3.98 m/s requires attention.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30538.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close at 8.59m longitudinal and -14.67m lateral distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Longitudinal closing velocity of -0.36 m/s and lateral closing velocity of 6.23 m/s indicate a developing risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
