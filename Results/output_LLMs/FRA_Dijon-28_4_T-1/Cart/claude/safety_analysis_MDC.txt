Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.1 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario for potential collisions, focusing on obstacles in lanelet 84 where the ego vehicle is located.

### Safety Analysis:

1. Obstacle ID: 30529
- Distance Risk: Moderate risk - Located in same lanelet (84), but maintaining safe longitudinal distance (~35m ahead)
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk: Low risk - High relative velocity but sufficient distance
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

2. Obstacle ID: 30532
- Distance Risk: High risk - In same lanelet (84), relatively close proximity (~7m ahead)
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk: Moderate risk - Lower velocity but closing distance
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 2

3. Obstacle ID: 30533
- Distance Risk: Low risk - Same lanelet but far ahead (~50m)
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk: Low risk - High relative velocity but large distance
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

4. Obstacle ID: 30537
- Distance Risk: High risk - In same lanelet (84), close proximity (~20m ahead)
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk: Moderate risk - Similar velocity profile
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

Key Observations:
1. The ego vehicle is traveling at a decreasing velocity (from 1.32 to 0.14 m/s)
2. Most critical interaction is with Obstacle 30532 due to close proximity
3. Other vehicles in the same lanelet maintain safer distances

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

While there are some high-risk situations (particularly with Obstacle 30532), none of the interactions qualify as extreme risk (score 1) or immediate collision risk (score 0). The ego vehicle's low and decreasing velocity helps mitigate potential collision risks, and all obstacles maintain sufficient separation distances despite sharing the same lanelet.

The main risk factors are:
1. Multiple vehicles in the same lanelet
2. Varying relative velocities
3. Close proximity with Obstacle 30532

However, the scenario maintains basic safety margins and doesn't present immediate collision risks.
