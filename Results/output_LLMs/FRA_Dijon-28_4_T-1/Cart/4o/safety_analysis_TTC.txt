Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.1 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.1: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 30529.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is relatively close. Given the obstacle's higher velocity, it moves forward at a faster rate than the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Due to the large relative velocity, the TTC is reasonable, allowing time for the ego vehicle to safely adjust.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30530.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in a different lanelet, with enough distance to avoid immediate collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Lateral distance ensures adequate TTC in the lateral direction.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30532.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle but with a moderate separation.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Appropriately spaced, allowing some TTC, but attention needed due to them sharing a lane.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30533.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Despite being in the same lanelet, it is currently further ahead with high velocity.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity and greater distance reduce the risk over time.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30534.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned significantly away from the ego vehicle in a different lanelet.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Obstacleâ€™s trajectory and velocity ensure minimal risk of intersection with ego vehicle.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30535.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Adequate separation in both lateral and longitudinal directions.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Different lanelet and moving away at a decent rate.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30536.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Located far from the ego vehicle and in an unrelated trajectory.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Similar trajectory to 30534 with negligible collision potential.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30537.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Relatively close and in the same lanelet, hence some proximity concerns.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Sufficient TTC is present with moderate considerations for reaction.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30538.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in a separate lanelet with reasonable clearance.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC is favorable due to distance and trajectory differences.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30539.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: In a different lanelet with adequate separation.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Distance and trajectory minimize collision risk over time.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```
In this scenario, given the evaluations, no obstacles have an overall risk score of 0 or 1, indicating there are no immediate collision or extreme risk concerns.
