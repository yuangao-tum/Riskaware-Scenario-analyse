Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.1 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories and shapes of vehicles aren't provided, we'll make some simplifying assumptions for this analysis.  We'll treat vehicles as points and primarily consider their current positions, velocities, and accelerations to estimate TTC and MDC.  A more rigorous analysis would require detailed trajectory predictions and vehicle dimensions.  We will define a "dangerous" proximity threshold for MDC as 2 meters and a "dangerous" TTC threshold as 2 seconds.  These thresholds are arbitrary and should be adjusted based on the specific autonomous driving system's requirements. We will consider both longitudinal and lateral components of motion separately for a better understanding of the risk.


**Calculations and Reasoning:**
Due to the complexity of accurate TTC and MDC calculations with the provided limited data, I will provide qualitative estimations based on the given information. A comprehensive analysis would necessitate more data, including vehicle dimensions and future trajectories.


**### Obstacle Analysis:**

- **Obstacle ID: 30529**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and relatively close behind.  Its higher velocity suggests it is approaching the ego vehicle.
    - Distance safety score: 3
    - Time Risk reason: While approaching from behind, the velocity difference is significant. Needs close monitoring.
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30530**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet, but laterally close to the ego vehicle. The position and different orientation suggests a possible lane change scenario that needs attention.
    - Distance safety score: 3
    - Time Risk reason:  The relatively high velocity of this obstacle combined with its proximity necessitates cautious monitoring.
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30532**
    - Distance Risk reason: Situated very close behind the ego vehicle in the same lanelet. This proximity presents a significant risk.
    - Distance safety score: 2
    - Time Risk reason: Its velocity is higher than the ego vehicle, increasing the likelihood of a collision if the ego vehicle doesn't accelerate or the obstacle doesn't decelerate.
    - Time safety score: 2
    - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30533**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located further behind than other obstacles in the same lanelet.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason:  While its velocity is high, its distance provides some buffer.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30534**
    - Distance Risk reason: In a different lanelet and further away laterally.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason:  High velocity but not an immediate threat due to lateral separation.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30535**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet and further away, posing minimal risk.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason:  Not a significant concern due to the distance and different lanelet.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30536**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Similar to obstacle 30534.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Similar to obstacle 30534.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30537**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, and quite close.
    - Distance safety score: 3
    - Time Risk reason: Poses a moderate risk due to its velocity and proximity.
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30538**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located behind the ego vehicle in a different lanelet, posing less of a risk.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason:  Its velocity and trajectory need monitoring, but not an immediate concern.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30539**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located behind the ego vehicle in a different lanelet with a moderate distance, reducing the risk.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: The current trajectory and velocity do not pose a significant immediate threat.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4
