### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID**: 30721.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: With a DTC of longitudinal 6.55 m and lateral 16.68 m, the distance suggests the obstacle is relatively close but not at immediate risk. However, it is driving toward the ego car.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative longitudinal velocity of -1.87 m/s calculates a TTC of approx. 3.5 seconds (6.55 m / 1.87 m/s). This indicates a moderate risk of collision.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID**: 30722.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The DTC is 25.35 m longitudinally and -46.33 m laterally, indicating that the obstacle is moving away and is not in danger of a collision.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Since it's moving away with positive relative velocities, there is no collision risk. 
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID**: 30723.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Exact alignment longitudinally (0.0 m) suggests immediate proximity.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC is approaching agent with longitudinal speed of -1.87 m/s; the TTC is effectively instant (0s).
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID**: 30724.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Real DTC longitudinal 3.17 m, moving toward the ego car, indicates high risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity of -1.46 m/s gives a TTC of about 2.17 seconds (3.17 m / 1.46 m/s), indicating urgent attention is needed.
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID**: 30725.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: DTC longitudinally 0.0 m (exact alignment) with a significant lateral DTC suggests it's coming close from the left.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Immediate longitudinal alignment with a negative relative velocity, indicating an urgent collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID**: 30726.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving away with DTC 17.27 m longitudinally and -20.02 m laterally. 
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Positive velocity indicates increasing distance, no collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

7. **Obstacle ID**: 30727.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Further away with DTC longitudinally 28.99 m and -37.4 m laterally.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away, no risk of collision.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

8. **Obstacle ID**: 30728.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Exact longitudinal alignment (0.0 m) indicates high proximity from the left.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC is immediate (0s). Urgent attention needed.
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

9. **Obstacle ID**: 30729.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: DTC 33.72 m longitudinally and 14.91 m laterally indicates no immediate collision risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle moves away, ensuring no risks.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

10. **Obstacle ID**: 30731.0 to 30742.0
   - These obstacles, due to their distances and relative velocities, predominantly have either negligible or extreme risk scores but provide ongoing potential danger (i.e., behind, longitudinal distances that are negative mean encroaching safety concerns).

### Summary in JSON Format:
