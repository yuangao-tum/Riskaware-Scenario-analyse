### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID**: 30721.0
   - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance is relatively short (6.55 m) and the relative velocity indicates the obstacle is approaching (-1.87 m/s).
   - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: TTC is calculated as DTClong / |Vrel_long| = 6.55 / 1.87 = 3.49 seconds; however, with the obstacle closing in, urgency is warranted.
   - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID**: 30722.0
   - Distance Risk reason: Far distance longitudinally (25.35 m) and moving away laterally (-12.96 m) implies minimal collision risk.
