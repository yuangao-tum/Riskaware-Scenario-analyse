### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**General Notes:**  TTC calculations assume constant velocity.  In reality, accelerations will influence TTC.  Additionally, a simple TTC calculation can be misleading if the relative velocity is very small or zero.  We'll incorporate distance and motion description to provide a more comprehensive risk assessment.

- **Obstacle ID: 30721.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively close longitudinally (6.55m) and moderately close laterally (16.68m) in the front-left. Driving towards ego longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching ego longitudinally. Negative longitudinal velocity implies collision risk if the trend continues.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30722.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Safe distance both longitudinally (25.35m) and laterally (-46.33m) in the front-right, moving away from ego.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from ego.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30723.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Laterally close (12.56m) to the left, same longitudinal position. No lateral relative motion reported, but the exact alignment and lack of longitudinal motion from the obstacle (Vrel_long = ego's velocity) raise concern.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal velocity implies collision risk if ego brakes. 
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30724.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Very close longitudinally (3.17m) and moderately close laterally (24.61m) in the front-left. Moving towards ego both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Approaching ego both longitudinally and laterally.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30725.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Laterally somewhat close (34.86m) to the left, same longitudinal position. Moving towards ego laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal velocity implies collision risk if ego brakes.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


- **Obstacle ID: 30726.0**

- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30732.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Laterally moderately close (20.47m) to the left, same longitudinal position. Moving towards ego laterally.
