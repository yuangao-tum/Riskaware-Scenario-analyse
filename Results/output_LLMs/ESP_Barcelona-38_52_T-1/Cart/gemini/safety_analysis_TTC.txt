Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.6 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories, dimensions of vehicles, and detailed lanelet shapes are not provided,  I will make reasonable assumptions for demonstration:

* **Vehicle Dimensions:**  Assume both ego and obstacle vehicles are roughly rectangular with a length of 4 meters and a width of 2 meters.
* **TTC Calculation:** TTC will be simplified to a straight-line projection based on current velocities.  A more accurate assessment would require future trajectory predictions.
* **MDC Calculation:**  MDC will be Euclidean distance. A more accurate calculation would need to consider vehicle shapes and orientations.
* **Lanelet Information:** Lanelet information is used to understand the general relationship between the ego vehicle and obstacles but precise boundaries are not available for exact collision checks.

**Calculations and Reasoning:** Note that these are estimations.
