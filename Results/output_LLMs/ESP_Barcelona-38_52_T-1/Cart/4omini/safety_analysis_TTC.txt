Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.6 seconds):
To conduct a safety analysis of the ego vehicle's potential collisions, we will first identify the obstacles that are in the same lanelet or trajectory as the ego vehicle, calculate the metrics (TTC and MDC), and provide a detailed evaluation of each obstacle.

Given the obstacles listed above and the necessary calculations, we will perform calculations considering the distances and speeds.

### Obstacle Analysis:
**Note**: For simplification, we will analyze the closest obstacles with potentially significant interactions first.

#### Example Detailed Evaluation for Obstacles:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30721.0**
   - **Position**: (113.5675, 181.7285)
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Calculated distance is moderate due to relative position.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3
   - **Time Risk reason**: No vehicle movement means collision is possible if the ego does not maneuver quickly.
   - **Time safety score**: 2
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2

2. **Obstacle ID: 30722.0**
   - **Position**: (155.7004, 127.2726)
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Well off trajectory but relative speed is substantial.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Closest approach would take more than 2 seconds therefore manageable.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 30724.0**
   - **Position**: (107.4781, 187.8221)
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Very close proximity but stationary.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2
   - **Time Risk reason**: No movement indicates a potential impassable barrier.
   - **Time safety score**: 2
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2

4. **Obstacle ID: 30725.0**
   - **Position**: (99.5992, 195.7091)
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary and closely located.
   - **Distance safety score**: 1
   - **Time Risk reason**: Speed indicates immediate collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 1
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Collision Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 30727.0**
   - **Position**: (155.7543, 136.9164)
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Well beyond effective engagement range.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Speed does not threaten the ego vehicle's trajectory.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

6. **Obstacle ID: 30728.0**
   - **Position**: (90.4490, 204.8666)
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned too far to pose a threat.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Not on a collision course.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Summary of Findings
