Safety analysis for timestep 6.0 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 6.0 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3325
- Relative Direction: Rear-right
- Distance Risk Reason: DTC values show a safe distance longitudinally (11.83) and a moderate distance laterally (5.35), indicating a low risk of collision.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.5
- Time Risk Reason: TTC values indicate a safe time longitudinally (4.08) and no lateral risk as it is infinite. Thus, it represents a low collision potential.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5
- Overall Risk Score: 4

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3327
- Relative Direction: Rear-right
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance (7.44) and lateral distance (1.86) show a moderate risk due to the latter being less than 2.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 3  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 2
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 2.5
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal TTC (1.67) indicates more immediate risk while lateral is infinite. The risk is moderate.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4
- Overall Risk Score: 3

### Obstacle Analysis:
