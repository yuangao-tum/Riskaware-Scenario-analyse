### Safety analysis for timestep 6.0 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 3325.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance (-11.83 m) suggests that it is fairly close behind the ego vehicle. Lateral distance (-5.35 m) also indicates it is within a close range, but moving away laterally to the right.
   - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: With a longitudinal relative velocity of 2.9 m/s, the time to collision (TTC = distance/velocity = 11.83/2.9 = 4.07 seconds) indicates more than 4 seconds left, which is manageable.
   - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 3327.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance (-7.44 m) is very close to the ego vehicle. Lateral distance (-1.86 m) indicates it is also in a concerning position.
   - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: With a longitudinal relative velocity of 4.46 m/s, the TTC is approximately 1.67 seconds, meaning it is approaching quickly.
   - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 3328.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance (-25.06 m) indicates it is further back and relatively safe. Lateral distance (-5.31 m) suggests it's still in a potential overlap area.
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal velocity of 1.73 m/s gives a TTC of about 14.5 seconds, indicating good time for mitigation.
   - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 3329.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance (-37.42 m) indicates it is safe distance, while lateral distance (-5.26 m) needs to be monitored.
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Given its low relative velocity, the TTC is quite high, showing an adequate buffer.
   - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 3330.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance (76.38 m) is very safe, lateral (7.57 m) also indicates no immediate concern.
   - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving toward the ego vehicle, but the distance gives ample time for the ego vehicle to maneuver.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID: 3331.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 54.3 m ahead, posing a negligible risk.
   - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: With relative velocity of 6.07 m/s, TTC is 9 seconds, which again indicates no immediate threat.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

7. **Obstacle ID: 3332.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Safe distance at 65.31 m longitudinally and 7.29 m laterally.
   - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The obstacle does not pose a risk in terms of TTC either.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

8. **Obstacle ID: 3344.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal (72.9 m) and lateral distance (15.72 m).
   - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: There’s no immediate collision risk.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

9. **Obstacle ID: 3343.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal (-19.46) and lateral (-29.45) indicate that it’s moderately risky but manageable.
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Given that it’s coming from the side at a significant speed, TTC is concerning.
   - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

10. **Obstacle ID: 3349.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: In collision zone at distance 0.0 m.
   - Distance safety score: 0 (Collision)
   - Time Risk reason: Right in the path with significant relative velocity.
   - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 0 (Collision)
