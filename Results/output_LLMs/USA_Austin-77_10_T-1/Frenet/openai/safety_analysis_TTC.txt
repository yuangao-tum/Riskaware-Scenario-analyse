### Safety analysis for timestep 6.0 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 3325.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Real distance indicates -11.83 m longitudinally and -5.35 m laterally. The asset is 11.83 m behind the ego car and laterally 5.35 m to the right, indicating it is close.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC longitudinal = (-11.83 m)/(2.9 m/s) = 4.07 s, and TTC lateral is not a concern here. The longitudinal TTC indicates a potential collision risk if actions are not taken soon. 
   - **Time safety score**: 3 
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2

2. **Obstacle ID: 3327.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: -7.44 m longitudinal, -1.86 m laterally indicates a very close obstacle in the rear-right.

   - **Overall Risk score**: 4  

4. **Obstacle ID: 3329.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: -37.42 m longitudinally and -5.26 m laterally indicates a further distance with no immediate concern.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC longitudinal = -37.42 m/(0.22 m/s) = 170.09 s, indicating a low collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4   

5. **Obstacle ID: 3330.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Real distance of 76.38 m longitudinal and 7.57 m laterally indicates a safe distance.

   - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal TTC = 76.38 m/(-5.47 m/s) = -13.96 s suggests the obstacle is moving away, no risk of collision.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5   

6. **Obstacle ID: 3331.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: 54.3 m longitudinally and -4.37 m laterally shows a safe distance.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC = 54.3 m/(6.07 m/s) = 8.95 s; sufficient time to avoid collision.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5   

7. **Obstacle ID: 3332.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Safe distance of 65.31 m longitudinally and 7.29 m laterally.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC = 65.31 m/(-5.47 m/s) = -11.94 s indicates a low risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5   

8. **Obstacle ID: 3360.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The safe distance of 72.96 m longitudinally and 43.64 m laterally indicates a very good margin.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC = 72.96 m/(-5.47 m/s) = -13.33 s indicates a non-collision.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5   

9. **Obstacle ID: 3340.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Safe distance of 76.4 m longitudinally and 15.89 m laterally.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC = 76.4 m/(-5.47 m/s) = -13.93 s indicates distance control.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5   

10. **Obstacle ID: 3348.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Distance of -19.41 m longitudinally and -40.15 m laterally indicates proximity but manageable.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 
   - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal TTC = -19.41 m/(-5.48 m/s) = 3.55 s indicates an improving situation.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3   

11. **Obstacle ID: 3343.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: -19.46 m longitudinally and -29.45 m laterally indicate closeness but manageable distance.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 
   - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal TTC = -19.46 m/(-5.47 m/s) = 3.56 s, still a risk, but manageable.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3  

12. **Obstacle ID: 3341.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Safe distance of 53.97 m longitudinally and at 0.0 m laterally indicates no risk in the forward direction.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 
   - **Time Risk reason**: No risk indicated in TTC as there is lateral motion away.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5
