### Safety analysis for timestep 6.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 3325.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is at a longitudinal distance of -11.83m and lateral distance of -5.35m, moving laterally away.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC for longitudinal direction is approximately 11.83m / 2.9m/s ≈ 4.08s, manageable time to react.
   - **Time safety score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

2. **Obstacle ID: 3327.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is closer with longitudinal distance of -7.44m and is moving laterally away.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC for longitudinal direction is approximately 7.44m / 4.46m/s ≈ 1.67s, requires quick attention.
   - **Time safety score**: 2
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2

3. **Obstacle ID: 3328.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is at a safe longitudinal distance of -25.06m, moving laterally away.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC is approximately 25.06m / 1.73m/s ≈ 14.48s, providing ample time to react.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

4. **Obstacle ID: 3329.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is at -37.42m, moving laterally away.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low relative velocity makes TTC very high or no imminent risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

5. **Obstacle ID: 3330.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is quite far at 76.38m.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: High longitudinal distance with negative relative velocity (closing in), but no immediate collision indicator.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

6. **Obstacle ID: 3331.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: At 54.3m, obstacle moving away with increasing lateral separation.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Moving longitudinally away at 6.07 m/s; TTC not a concern.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

7. **Obstacle ID: 3332.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Close longitudinal distance at 65.31m with negative velocity closing in.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Potential closure but not in immediate need of reaction.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

8. **Obstacle ID: 3334.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: At a longitudinal distance of 72.88m; closing but distant.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Far distance allows plenty of time to react.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

9. **Obstacle ID: 3335.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Safe distance at -48.87m, moving away.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Large distance and moving away; no immediate risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

10. **Obstacle ID: 3336.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Close at 15.57m but moving longitudinally away.
    - **Distance safety score**: 3
    - **Time Risk reason**: Sufficient TTC as it moves away.
    - **Time safety score**: 4
    - **Overall Risk score**: 4
