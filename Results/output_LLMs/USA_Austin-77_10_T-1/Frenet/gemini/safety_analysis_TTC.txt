### Safety analysis for timestep 6.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**General Notes:**  Lateral movement is generally less critical than longitudinal movement, especially when lateral distances are significant and lateral speeds are low.  A negative relative longitudinal velocity indicates the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally.  We'll prioritize TTC over MDC in our scoring, as TTC gives a better indication of imminent danger.  Since we don't have a specific ego vehicle size, we'll assume a safety buffer of approximately 2 meters for MDC calculations.


- **Obstacle ID: 3325.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Relatively close behind and slightly to the right.
    - Distance safety score: 2
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally, but moving away laterally.  TTC calculation tricky due to changing velocities, but potential for collision given the proximity.
    - Time safety score: 2
    - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 3327.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Very close behind and slightly to the right.
    - Distance safety score: 1
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally, but moving away laterally. Higher longitudinal velocity than 3325.0 increases the risk.
    - Time safety score: 1
    - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 3328.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Further behind than 3325 and 3327, and to the right.
    - Distance safety score: 3
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally, moving away laterally.  Less urgent than closer obstacles.
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3329.0**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Even further behind, and to the right.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason:  Low longitudinal closing velocity.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3330.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Far ahead and slightly to the left.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (oncoming traffic likely).  No immediate concern given the distance.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5


- **Obstacle ID: 3331.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Moderately far ahead and to the right.  Moving closer laterally.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, but approaching laterally. Lateral motion not immediately concerning.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3332.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Far ahead and to the right.
    - Distance safety score: 5

    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3334.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Far ahead and to the left.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason:  Approaching longitudinally (oncoming traffic). No immediate concern.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3335.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Far behind and to the right.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3336.0**
