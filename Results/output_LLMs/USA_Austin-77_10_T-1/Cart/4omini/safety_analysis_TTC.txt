Safety analysis for the last timestep (6.0 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 6: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

The ego vehicle is located in lanelet 797.0 and is currently at coordinates (346.6983, 300.6127) with a velocity of 5.466 m/s. Based on the information provided, we will identify the obstacles within the same lanelet (797.0) or relevant ones which may pose a risk based on distance and time to collision considerations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 3329.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The position of the obstacle is (352.9562, 342.6347), which is relatively far from the ego vehicle but in the same lanelet. The closest point of approach can still cause concern.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle has a velocity of 5.6844 and is moving close to the ego vehicle; however, the direction and distance reduce immediate threat.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 3349.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is at (347.9919, 304.5935), almost parallel to the ego vehicle. It's relatively close in lateral movement but not immediate.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Itâ€™s traveling faster (11.9656 m/s) towards a proximity that sets a critical collision path.
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 3336.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The position is quite aligned with the ego vehicle at (333.8503, 283.6429) and almost on the trajectory.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Its velocity (12.6564 m/s) approaching the ego vehicle is concerning.
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 3337.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is stationed at (340.4093, 327.892), significantly farther in trajectory-wise.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Stationary nature gives a very low collision probability irrespective of the proximity.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 3351.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at (359.734, 363.6319) it's further ahead in a different lanelet.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Its low velocity would not lead to immediate collision concerns.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID: 3353.0** 
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (357.1609, 215.9261), it's diagonal relative to the ego path and poses limited lateral risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The velocity remains moderate, posing minimal collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
``` 

### Conclusion:
The overall analysis reflects that while there are obstacles that pose a high or medium risk of collision in proximity, there are currently no obstacles directly causing an immediate collision risk (score of 0) or extreme risk (score of 1). Timely adjustments in paths and acceleration would be necessary to prevent any escalation from the observed risks.
