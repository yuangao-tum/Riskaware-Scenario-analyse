### Safety Analysis for timestep 3.8 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30784.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance (-6.79 m) indicates it's relatively close, but laterally (12.67 m) it's at a safe distance from the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinally, the obstacle is moving away (-1.8 m/s), resulting in a TTC of approximately 3.77 seconds (Distance/Velocity). Lateral motion is away (0.94 m/s), posing minimal risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 30785.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinally (-12.19 m) it's somewhat far, but laterally (25.79 m) it is getting closer to the ego car.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinally, the relative motion is away (1.04 m/s), giving a TTC of approximately 11.72 seconds. Lateral motion (-6.54 m/s) poses a significant urgency.
  - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2

- **Obstacle ID:** 30787.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is laterally close (1.66 m) but aligned in the same lane (0.0 m longitudinally); hence, it poses a danger.
  - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** TTC is less than 1 second. Collisions are imminent due to co-alignment.
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1

- **Obstacle ID:** 30788.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Fairly far longitudinally (15.13 m) but uses no lateral buffer (-43.47 m).
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinally moving toward -1.67 m/s gives a TTC of approx 9 seconds; hence a low risk of immediate collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30789.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinally near (-27.07 m) with lateral motion close (33.8 m) heading towards the ego vehicle from behind.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** TTC is about 5.39 seconds, indicating a concerning situation if the ego vehicle does not increase separation.
  - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 30790.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Distances (-41.86 m longitudinally and 44.69 m laterally) indicate safety, but it's rapidly approaching.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Relative velocity indicates impending danger longitudinally leading to a TTC of around 8.52 seconds.
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30796.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Very close (-0.29 m) longitudinally indicates significant risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Almost immediate collision based on high rearward motion (6.7 m/s) leading to a TTC of about 0.04 seconds.
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1

- **Obstacle ID:** 30851.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Safe distance longitudinally (-49.77 m) and well positioned laterally (76.58 m).
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Lateral motion towards and available TTC gives around 30 seconds, indicating no imminent threat.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30796.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30787.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

### Conclusion:
From the assessment, there are significant concerns regarding obstacles that pose imminent collision risks (30787.0) and critical extreme risk (30796.0). Most of other obstacles are manageable if proper reactions and adjustments are made by the ego vehicle based on relative velocities and distances.
