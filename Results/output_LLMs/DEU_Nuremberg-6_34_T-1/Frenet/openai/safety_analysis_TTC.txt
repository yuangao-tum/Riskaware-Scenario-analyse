### Safety analysis for timestep 3.8: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID:** 30784.0  
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is 6.79 m longitudinally behind and 12.67 m to the left. It is moving away from the ego vehicle.  
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)  
   - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle has a longitudinal relative velocity of -1.8 m/s and is moving away, resulting in a TTC of 3.78 seconds. The lateral velocity is positive (0.94 m/s), indicating non-convergence.  
   - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)  
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)  

2. **Obstacle ID:** 30785.0  
   - **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is 12.19 m behind and 25.79 m to the left, moving away longitudinally but closing in laterally.  
   - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)  
   - **Time Risk reason:** The longitudinal velocity is approximately stationary, and lateral movement towards the ego vehicle suggests a TTC of around 5.39 seconds (before it reaches the ego vehicle).  
   - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)  
   - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)  

3. **Obstacle ID:** 30787.0  
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is directly aligned at 0.0 m longitudinally and 1.66 m to the left, indicating immediate proximity.  
   - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)  
   - **Time Risk reason:** With a longitudinal velocity of -1.67 m/s, the TTC is 0 seconds (imminent overlap).  
   - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)  
   - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)  

4. **Obstacle ID:** 30788.0  
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle at 15.13 m front-right is moving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally, creating a potential impact point.  
   - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)  
   - **Time Risk reason:** The longitudinal velocity is -1.67 m/s, leading to a TTC of approximately 9.06 seconds.  
   - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)  
   - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)  

5. **Obstacle ID:** 30789.0  
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned 27.07 m in the rear-left, moving rapidly toward the ego vehicle, indicating potential danger.  
   - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)  
   - **Time Risk reason:** The longitudinal velocity suggests an imminent risk with a TTC of about 5.39 seconds.  
   - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)  
   - **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)  

6. **Obstacle ID:** 30790.0  
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Located 41.86 m behind and left, moving toward the ego vehicle, thus maintaining some risk.  
   - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)  
   - **Time Risk reason:** The TTC suggests a collision risk in 7 seconds given its negative relative velocity.  
   - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)  
   - **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)  

7. **Obstacle ID:** 30791.0  
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned 59.49 m behind and moving away indicates minimal threat.  
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)  
   - **Time Risk reason:** Safe as it is moving away, with a TTC of approximately -35.63 seconds (i.e., no risk).  
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)  
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)  

8. **Obstacle ID:** 30792.0  
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned fairly far behind (39.8 m) adds a moderate risk, given it also moves laterally closer.  
   - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)  
   - **Time Risk reason:** Slight lateral motion raises concerns with a TTC that indicates action might be needed.  
   - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)  
   - **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)  

9. **Obstacle ID:** 30796.0  
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Located directly behind the vehicle (0.29 m) with an immediate longitudinal threat.  
   - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)  
   - **Time Risk reason:** This obstacle has a relative velocity of 6.7 m/s indicates a collision is imminent (0.04 sec).  
   - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)  
   - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)  

10. **Obstacle ID:** 30815.0  
    - **Distance Risk reason:** The closest obstacle moving toward the ego vehicle laterally (0.81 m longitudinally).  
    - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)  
    - **Time Risk reason:** Given the lateral movement, this presents an immediate risk with a very short TTC.  
    - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)  
    - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
