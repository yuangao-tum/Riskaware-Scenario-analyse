### Safety analysis for timestep 3.8 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
#### Obstacle 30784.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is positioned at a rear-left angle with a fair longitudinal distance of -6.79m and a relatively safe lateral distance of 12.67m. The real distances indicate minimal immediate risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's relative longitudinal motion is moving away at -1.8 m/s, suggesting increased time before any potential impact. Lateral motion also suggests moving away.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle 30785.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned rear-left with significant distances of -12.19m longitudinally and 25.79m laterally. This suggests low immediate risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away longitudinally at a velocity of -0.05 m/s, indicating a negligible likelihood of collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30787.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle directly on the left with a critical lateral distance of only 1.66m, which poses a medium risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Stationary in the lateral direction, implying a constant risk unless it alters its trajectory.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle 30788.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned front-right with considerable distance, both longitudinally at 15.13m and laterally at -43.47m, indicating low risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Moving toward the ego vehicle at a longitudinal velocity of -1.67 m/s, but given the significant distance, risk remains low.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle 30789.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is rear-left with large distances (-27.07m longitudinally and 33.8m laterally), suggesting negligible risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal velocity of 5.02 m/s suggests the obstacle is closing in, but given the distance, immediate risk is low.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle 30790.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Rear-left with safe distances (-41.86m longitudinally and 44.69m laterally), low risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Despite relative velocity 4.91 m/s suggesting it's approaching, the large distance ensures low immediate risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle 30791.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Adequate separation at -59.49m longitudinally and 58.06m laterally, ensuring negligible risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Moving away at -9.18 m/s longitudinally, reducing any proximity risks.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30792.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Rear-left with significant lateral (32.61m) and longitudinal separation (-39.8m).
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Moving toward the vehicle but without significant immediate impact potential due to reduced acceleration.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle 30793.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned rear-left with aggressive real distances, showing low immediate risks.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Stationary movement indicates no immediate impending threat.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30794.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinally (-39.32m) and laterally (47.29m) safely distanced.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The stationary relative movement further limits collision probability.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5
