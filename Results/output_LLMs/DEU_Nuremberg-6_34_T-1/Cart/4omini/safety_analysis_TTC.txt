Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.8 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.8 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

To analyze the scenario, I will compute the Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) for each obstacle and evaluate the risk levels accordingly.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30784.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: 14.827 units away from the ego vehicle, posing a moderate distance risk due to proximity.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium risk due to proximity)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC longitudinally is 6.74 seconds longitudinally; however, no lateral risk is present as the obstacle is not in the direct path.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk, sufficient time to respond)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30785.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: 14.694 units away, indicating a moderate distance risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium risk due to closeness)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC longitudinally is 2.87 seconds; therefore, while closer, thereâ€™s still manageable time.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium risk with some urgency required)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30787.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Sufficiently distant (5.28 units); no immediate concern.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC is high (6.53 seconds); ample time is present.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30788.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is over 13.851 units away, indicating a safe distance.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: High TTC with no imminent threat (8.72 seconds).
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30789.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at a distance of 34.518 units, indicating a safe distance.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: High TTC (7.33 seconds); no risk posed.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30790.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Closely approaching at a distance of 14.874 units.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC is low (2.09 seconds); needs attention.
  - **Time safety score**: 2 (High risk due to proximity)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30791.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at a distance of 22.263 units; manageable.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC is at 3.35 seconds, manageably close.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30792.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Situated at a distance of 9.543 units; invoking caution.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC is 1.54 seconds; urgent tactical response is required.
  - **Time safety score**: 2 (High risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30796.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: 2.334 units away, presenting a very high proximity threat.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC is less than 1 second; immediate action is required.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30796.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

In summary, there is an extreme risk from obstacle ID 30796.0; other obstacles range from medium to low risk, indicating general caution is required, but immediate collision threats are minimal.
