Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.8 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.8: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories, dimensions of vehicles, and lanelet geometries are not provided, I'm making simplified calculations based on Euclidean distances and straight-line projections.  A more robust analysis would require the missing information.  I'll define a "danger zone" around the ego vehicle – a circle with a radius of (e.g., 5 meters).  Any obstacle within this zone will be flagged as higher risk.  Similarly, a TTC threshold (e.g., 3 seconds) will be used.

**Calculations and Reasoning:**

I will demonstrate the calculations for a few obstacles, and summarize the results for the rest.

**Example Calculation (Obstacle 30784):**

* **Ego Position:** (573.4941, 107.5831)
* **Obstacle 30784 Position:** (572.6663, 125.7723)
* **Distance:** sqrt((573.4941 - 572.6663)^2 + (107.5831 - 125.7723)^2) ≈ 18.2 meters
* **Ego Velocity:** 1.6714 m/s
* **Obstacle 30784 Velocity:** 0.9446 m/s
* **Relative Velocity (approximation):**  Difficult to determine precisely without directional vectors, but assumed small in this example for simplification.

Assuming a danger zone of 5 meters and a TTC threshold of 3 seconds, Obstacle 30784 is not immediately dangerous, but bears monitoring.

**Important Notes:**  This analysis is a simplified approximation. Without lanelet geometries, accurate trajectories, and vehicle dimensions, a definitive collision assessment is impossible.  The provided data is insufficient for precise TTC and MDC calculations, especially considering lateral movement and non-linear trajectories.  A real-world autonomous driving system would require much more detailed information and sophisticated algorithms to guarantee safety.
