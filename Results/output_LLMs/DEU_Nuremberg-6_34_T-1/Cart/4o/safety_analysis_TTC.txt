Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.8 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.8 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30784
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is located at a decent distance laterally, and more significant longitudinally, with no immediate threat on the current trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: The velocities and accelerations suggest a low probability of collision in the near future.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30785
- **Distance Risk reason**: Situated ahead but on a different trajectory; due care should be observed owing to its higher velocity.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Fast enough not to pose immediate TTC issues with timely adjustments possible.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30787
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is nearby and stationary, making it of mild concern.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Zero velocity implies no time risk unless changes occur.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30788
- **Distance Risk reason**: Situated further away, with no foreseeable approach trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Lack of motion equates to negligible time risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30789
- **Distance Risk reason**: Considerable distance and differing lanelet render minimal distance risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: High speed, however, is on a different lanelet and hence minimal time risk as well.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30790
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned a noticeable distance longitudinally ahead, on a different lanelet.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Fast-moving but non-threatening to current path.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30791
- **Distance Risk reason**: Substantial distance and no direct impact path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Moving fast, yet lateral displacement obliterates time risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30813
- **Distance Risk reason**: Notably south and stationary, moderate distance, no serious distance risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Inactive movement ensures no time risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Summary in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Since no obstacles present themselves as an immediate collision risk (Score: 0) or extreme risk (Score: 1), the JSON output reflects 'null' for both categories.
