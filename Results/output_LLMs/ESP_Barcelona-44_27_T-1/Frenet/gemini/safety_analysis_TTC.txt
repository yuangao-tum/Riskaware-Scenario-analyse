### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**General Notes:**  Several obstacles are extremely close longitudinally (DTClong near zero) and approaching with negative relative longitudinal velocity, indicating a high risk of collision.  Lateral movement must be carefully considered to fully assess risk.  For TTC calculations, if the relative velocity is positive (moving away), TTC is considered infinite, represented here as "Inf". If DTC is 0, TTC is also 0.

**Methodology:**  Overall risk score is determined by taking the minimum of the distance and time risk scores. This reflects that a vehicle can be safe in one aspect (e.g., time) but at extreme risk due to another (e.g., distance).

- **Obstacle ID: 30743.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: DTClong is very small (1.02m) and the obstacle is approaching longitudinally.  Lateral distance is moderate, but the obstacle is also approaching laterally.
    - Distance safety score: 1
    - Time Risk reason:  Negative longitudinal velocity indicates approaching. Time to collision is imminent.
    - Time safety score: 1
    - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30744.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Moderate longitudinal distance (6.68m), but the obstacle is approaching.  Lateral distance is significant and the obstacle is moving away laterally.
    - Distance safety score: 3
    - Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal velocity indicates approaching.
    - Time safety score: 2
    - Overall Risk score: 2
