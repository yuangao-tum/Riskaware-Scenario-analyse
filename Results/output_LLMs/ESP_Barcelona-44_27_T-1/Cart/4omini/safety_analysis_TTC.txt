Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.3 seconds):
This scenario includes numerous obstacles and the ego vehicle with its detailed state information. Let's evaluate the potential collision risks step by step.

### Step 1: Identify Relevant Obstacles
The ego vehicle is located in lanelet 3235.0. Relevant obstacles in lanelets that may interact with lanelet 3235.0 (evaluating the obstacles with an adjacent position) need to be considered. From the list, the following obstacles are in close proximity to lanelet 3235.0:
- Obstacle 30760.0

### Step 2: Calculate Metrics
To estimate the potential collision risks, we must calculate both the Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) for the identified obstacle.

#### Obstacle 30760.0 Analysis:
- **Ego Vehicle's Position**: (349.2288, 226.5079) 
- **Ego Vehicle's Velocity**: 4.0729
- **Obstacle Position**: (352.5649, 229.7083)
- **Obstacle Velocity**: 10.147

##### Calculations:
1. **Distance Calculation**: 
   - Euclidean distance between the ego vehicle and the obstacle:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(352.5649 - 349.2288)^2 + (229.7083 - 226.5079)^2} = \sqrt{(3.3361)^2 + (3.2004)^2} \approx 4.66 \, \text{units}
   \]

2. **Relative Velocity Calculation**: 
   - The relative velocity (longitudinal) can be calculated as:
   \[
   V_{rel} = V_{obstacle} - V_{ego} = 10.147 - 4.0729 = 6.0741 \, \text{units/second}
   \]

3. **Time to Collision (TTC)**:
   \[
   \text{TTC} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Velocity}} = \frac{4.66}{6.0741} \approx 0.768 \, \text{seconds}
   \]

4. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - The calculated distance (4.66 units) is used as the MDC.

### Step 3: Risk Assessment
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The MDC of 4.66 units indicates a moderate distance which is relatively close. 
- **Distance Safety Score**: Given this distance, it is less than 10 units which suggests **Medium Risk (Score 3)**.

- **Time Risk Reason**: The TTC of 0.768 seconds indicates an immediate risk of collision since it is less than 1 second, which suggests a require for prompt action.
- **Time Safety Score**: Given a TTC of less than 1 second, this would classify as **High Risk (Score 2)**.

### Overall Risk Score:
The scores for distance and time metrics are combined to evaluate the overall risk:
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)

#### Combined Overall Risk Score:
- Since we observe a medium and high risk, we classify this under **high overall risk situations**, likely leading to a **High Risk (Score 2)**.

### Final Summary of Analysis:
Now, collating this information into the requested structure:

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30760.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The MDC of 4.66 indicates moderate proximity that requires awareness.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3
- **Time Risk Reason**: A TTC of 0.768 indicates imminent risk of collision.
- **Time Safety Score**: 2
- **Overall Risk Score**: 2
