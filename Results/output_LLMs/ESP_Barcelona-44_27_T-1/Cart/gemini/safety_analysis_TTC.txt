Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories, dimensions of vehicles, and lanelet geometries are not provided, I'm making simplified assumptions for demonstration:

* **TTC (Time to Collision):**  Approximated based on current velocities and positions.  A more accurate assessment would require future trajectory predictions.  I'll consider longitudinal (along the lanelet) and lateral TTC separately. A negative TTC value means the objects are moving away from each other.
* **MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision):** Calculated as the Euclidean distance between ego and obstacle positions. This is a snapshot at 5.3 seconds.
* **Lanelet Overlap:**  Obstacles in the same or adjacent lanelets are considered higher risk.
* **Risk Score:** Assigned based on TTC, MDC, and lanelet context.  Thresholds for risk levels are estimated due to lack of precise data.
