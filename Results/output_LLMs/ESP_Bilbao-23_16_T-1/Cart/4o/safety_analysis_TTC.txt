Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.0 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID**: 30921.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is located in a different lanelet (1362.0) than the ego vehicle (1383.0), but the positioning is relatively close. Although the lateral distance might raise concern, the current orientation suggests diverging paths.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: With a velocity of 8.1474 m/s, the obstacle is not directly in the path of the ego vehicle. The Ego's deceleration decreases potential risks over time.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID**: 30922.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at a considerable distance from the ego vehicle in lanelet 1499.0, suggesting a different trajectory.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: This obstacle's velocity and orientation do not project a collision path with the ego vehicle over time.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID**: 30923.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Sharing the same lanelet as 30922.0, indicating another separate trajectory from the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: With a stable velocity, the obstacle is less likely to intersect with the ego vehicle's path given the difference in lanelets and current speed.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5
