Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.0 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30921.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30921.0 is in a different lanelet (1362.0) than the ego vehicle (1383.0), but its lateral position (166.7027, -303.7581) is very close to the ego vehicle's position (171.1152, -305.7903).  This proximity, despite being in different lanelets, suggests a potential lateral collision risk, especially given the difference in orientations. More information on lanelet geometry and vehicle dimensions is needed for precise MDC calculation and risk assessment.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity (8.1474) is significantly higher than the ego vehicle's (3.1642), and they are moving in different orientations (-1.0179 vs 0.1598).  This speed differential combined with the close proximity and differing headings increases the risk of a collision in the near future.  Precise TTC calculation requires more detailed trajectory information.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30922.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 30922.0 is in a different lanelet (1499.0) and further away from the ego vehicle compared to Obstacle 30921.0. Its position suggests a lower immediate risk, although its higher velocity needs consideration. More information on lanelet geometry and vehicle dimensions is needed for precise MDC calculation.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Although further away, its higher velocity (8.3635) and acceleration (0.6129) compared to the ego vehicle could pose a risk in the near future, especially if trajectories intersect.  Precise TTC requires future trajectory information.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30923.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is the furthest away and in a different lanelet (1499.0), suggesting the lowest risk among the three.  However, its velocity is still high, requiring continuous monitoring. More information on lanelet geometry and vehicle dimensions is needed for precise MDC calculation.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Its higher velocity (8.2971) requires considering its future trajectory, but the greater distance provides more time for potential evasive maneuvers compared to the other obstacles. Precise TTC calculation requires future trajectory information.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
