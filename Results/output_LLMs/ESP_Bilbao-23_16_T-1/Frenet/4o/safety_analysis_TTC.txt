### Safety analysis for timestep 5.0 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30921.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** 
    - The obstacle is laterally close to the ego vehicle, with a lateral distance of only 1.1 m. This suggests a proximity risk, especially as it's moving towards the ego car.
  - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk, due to the close lateral proximity)
  - **Time Risk reason:** 
    - Lateral motion towards the ego car with a relative lateral velocity of -7.53 m/s suggests a potential quick intrusion into the ego space.
    - TTC (lateral): Due to the close proximity and speed, the TTC is calculated to be low, indicating urgent need for reaction.
  - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk, given the fast approaching lateral motion and short TTC)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk, based on both distance and time assessments)

- **Obstacle ID: 30922.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** 
    - The lateral distance is 14.61 m, posing a lower proximity threat compared to Obstacle 30921.0. However, the lateral approach at speed from the left should still be monitored.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk, with sufficient initial distance laterally)
  - **Time Risk reason:** 
    - The lateral velocity of -6.89 m/s requires attention as it can significantly reduce the safe distance quickly, but due to the 14.61 m initial lateral distance, immediate collision is less probable.
    - TTC estimations provide a buffered window for potential corrective action.
  - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk, manageable with timely intervention despite the lateral approach)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk, considering manageable latency in lateral encroachment)

- **Obstacle ID: 30923.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** 
    - Located primarily on the longitudinal front-left with a safe lateral distance of 28.12 m, but a somewhat closer longitudinal gap of 4.93 m.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk, longitudinal proximity requires vigilance)
  - **Time Risk reason:** 
    - The longitudinal approach at -7.3 m/s suggests decreasing time to potential interaction in the same longitudinal trajectory.
    - Although reasonably distant laterally, the forward motion must be considered due to the negative longitudinal velocity.
  - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk, requires immediate but manageable adjustments due to longitudinal closure rate)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk, requiring ongoing attention primarily because of forward approach)
