### Safety analysis for timestep 5.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30921.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is extremely close laterally (1.1m) and longitudinally aligned (0.0m) with the ego vehicle, indicating a very high risk of collision.  The lateral relative velocity is high (-7.53 m/s) suggesting the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:**  With such a small lateral distance and high lateral velocity, TTC will be very low. Although longitudinal velocity is small, the lateral movement poses significant immediate risk.
- **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30922.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** While further away than 30921.0, this obstacle is still relatively close laterally (14.61m) and longitudinally aligned (0.0m). The lateral and longitudinal relative velocities indicate it's moving towards the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:**  The combination of moderate lateral distance and converging velocities suggests a high risk, although not as immediate as 30921.0.
- **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30923.0
- **Distance Risk reason:**  This obstacle is further away both longitudinally (4.93m) and laterally (28.12m) compared to the other two. However, the negative relative velocities indicate it is approaching the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** While the distance provides some buffer, the converging velocities suggest the situation requires attention and potential action to avoid future collision.
- **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
