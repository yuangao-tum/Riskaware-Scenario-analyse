### Safety analysis for timestep 5.0 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**Obstacle ID: 30921.0**  
- **Distance Risk reason**: The real distance is longitudinal 0.0 m and lateral 1.1 m. This indicates that the obstacle is very close to the ego vehicle laterally. Given that it’s in a lateral right path and close proximity, the risk of collision is high.  
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: To calculate TTC:
  - Longitudinal TTC = DTClong / Vrel_long = 0.0 m / -0.04 m/s = undefined (as Vrel_long is negative, indicating movement towards).
  - Lateral TTC = DTClat / Vrel_lat = 1.1 m / -7.53 m/s ≈ 0.146 s (significant risk as it's a very short time until lateral contact).
  
  Overall, since the longitudinal component is undefined (signifying an imminent collision) and lateral TTC is also very short, the time risk is extremely high.  
- **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

**Obstacle ID: 30922.0**  
- **Distance Risk reason**: The real distance is longitudinal 0.0 m and lateral 14.61 m. Longitudinally, it is at the point of potential collision, and even though laterally there's more space available, the risk is pronounced.  
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk) 

- **Time Risk reason**: To calculate TTC:
  - Longitudinal TTC = DTClong / Vrel_long = 0.0 m / -7.9 m/s = undefined (movement towards)
  - Lateral TTC = DTClat / Vrel_lat = 14.61 m / -6.89 m/s ≈ 2.12 s.
  
  The longitudinal component indicates an immediate threat with an undefined TTC value, while the lateral is somewhat manageable.  
- **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

**Obstacle ID: 30923.0**  
- **Distance Risk reason**: The real distance is longitudinal 4.93 m and lateral 28.12 m. This shows that the obstacle is at a safe distance longitudinally and laterally, indicating less threat.  
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: To calculate TTC:
  - Longitudinal TTC = DTClong / Vrel_long = 4.93 m / -7.3 m/s ≈ 0.675 s (imminent but not critical).
  - Lateral TTC = DTClat / Vrel_lat = 28.12 m / -7.19 m/s ≈ 3.91 s.
  
  While the longitudinal TTC suggests an approaching obstacle, the longer lateral TTC gives it a more manageable risk level.  
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30921.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
```
In this analysis, O30921.0 and O30922.0 are both identified as presenting extreme risk with imminent collision potential, requiring urgent action. O30923.0 is analyzed as manageable, with a lower risk level.
