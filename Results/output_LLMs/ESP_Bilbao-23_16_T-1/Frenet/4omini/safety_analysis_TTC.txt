### Safety analysis for timestep 5.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
**Obstacle ID: 30921.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 0.0 m and lateral distance is 1.1 m. The obstacle is very close and driving toward the ego car laterally from the left, indicating a high risk of collision.
- **Distance safety score**: 1
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative lateral velocity (Vrel_lat = -7.53 m/s) indicates that the obstacle is moving rapidly towards the ego vehicle, which results in a very short Time to Collision (TTC). TTC can be calculated using the formula TTC = lateral distance / absolute lateral velocity, which gives TTC = 1.1 m / 7.53 m/s ≈ 0.15 seconds. This indicates an immediate risk of collision.
- **Time safety score**: 1
- **Overall Risk score**: 1

**Obstacle ID: 30922.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 0.0 m and lateral distance is 14.61 m. While it is driving toward the ego car laterally from the left, the greater lateral distance compared to Obstacle 30921.0 reduces the immediate risk somewhat.
- **Distance safety score**: 2
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocities provide a TTC of 14.61 m / 6.89 m/s ≈ 2.12 seconds, which indicates a high likelihood of collision in the near future but with some time for reaction.
- **Time safety score**: 2
- **Overall Risk score**: 2

**Obstacle ID: 30923.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 4.93 m and lateral distance is 28.12 m. This obstacle is in the front-left and while not directly in the same lane, the distance indicates it is relatively far compared to the other obstacles.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocities suggest a TTC of 4.93 m / 7.3 m/s ≈ 0.67 seconds (longitudinally) and 28.12 m / 7.19 m/s ≈ 3.91 seconds (laterally). The shorter TTC indicates a moderate risk of collision as it is closing in quickly longitudinally but not laterally.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3
