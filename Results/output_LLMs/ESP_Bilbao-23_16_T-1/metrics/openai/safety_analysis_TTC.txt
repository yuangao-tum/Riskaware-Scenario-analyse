Safety analysis for timestep 5.0 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.0 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30921
- Relative Direction: Left
- Distance Risk Reason: The longitudinal distance to collision (DTClong = 0.0) indicates an immediate collision risk since the ego vehicle is perfectly aligned with the obstacle, meaning that any forward movement could result in a collision. The lateral distance (DTClat = 1.1) is relatively safe but does not mitigate the imminent collision from the front.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
- Overall Distance Safety Score: DSC = 0 * 0 + 4 * (1 - 0) = 4
- Time Risk Reason: The longitudinal time to collision (TTClong = 0.0) indicates an immediate collision risk as well. The lateral time (TTClat = 0.15) is still quite low, indicating that a reaction to an impending collision is required quickly.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0  
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 1
- Overall Time Safety Score: TSC = 0 * 0 + 1 * (1 - 0) = 1
- Overall Risk Score: Risk Score = 0.5 * DSC + 0.5 * TSC = 0.5 * 4 + 0.5 * 1 = 2.5 (rounded to 3)

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30922
- Relative Direction: Left
- Distance Risk Reason: The longitudinal distance to collision (DTClong = 0.0) indicates an immediate collision risk due to alignment. The lateral distance (DTClat = 14.61) is safe, but it does not counteract the fact that the ego vehicle is aligned with the obstacle.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: DSC = 0 * 0 + 5 * (1 - 0) = 5
- Time Risk Reason: The longitudinal time to collision (TTClong = 0.0) signals a severe risk of a collision occurring immediately. The lateral time (TTClat = 2.12) is manageable, but the primary risk is the zero longitudinal time to collision.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0  
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 3
- Overall Time Safety Score: TSC = 0 * 0 + 3 * (1 - 0) = 3
- Overall Risk Score: Risk Score = 0.5 * DSC + 0.5 * TSC = 0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 3 = 4 (rounded to 4)

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30923
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: The longitudinal distance to collision (DTClong = 4.93) indicates a moderate risk but is manageable. The lateral distance (DTClat = 28.12) is safe, implying that there is no immediate lateral threat.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 3  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: DSC = 3 * 0.5 + 5 * (1 - 0.5) = 4
- Time Risk Reason: The longitudinal time to collision (TTClong = 0.68) presents a moderate risk since it is below 1 second, while the lateral time (TTClat = 3.91) is safe and adequate for reaction time.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 2  
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 4
- Overall Time Safety Score: TSC = 2 * 0.5 + 4 * (1 - 0.5) = 3
- Overall Risk Score: Risk Score = 0.5 * DSC + 0.5 * TSC = 0.5 * 4 + 0.5 * 3 = 3.5 (rounded to 4)
