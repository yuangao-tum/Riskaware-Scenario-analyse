Safety analysis for timestep 5.0 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.0 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID:** 30921
   - **Relative Direction:** Left
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** Both longitudinal distance to collision is 0.0 (immediate risk), with a lateral distance of 1.1, indicating that the obstacle is moving laterally toward the ego vehicle. 
   - **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 0  
   - **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 4
   - **Overall Distance Safety Score:** DSC = 0 * 0 + 4 * (1) = 0
   - **Time Risk Reason:** Longitudinal time to collision is 0.0 (immediate risk), and lateral time to collision is only 0.15 seconds, indicating an urgent situation. 
   - **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 0  
   - **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 1
   - **Overall Time Safety Score:** TSC = 0 * 0 + 1 * (1) = 0
   - **Overall Risk Score:** Risk Score = 0.5 * DSC + 0.5 * TSC = 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 0 = 0

2. **Obstacle ID:** 30922
   - **Relative Direction:** Left
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** Like the previous obstacle, longitudinal distance to collision is 0.0 (immediate risk), with a lateral distance of 14.61 (safe distance).
   - **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 0  
   - **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 5
   - **Overall Distance Safety Score:** DSC = 0 * 0 + 5 * (1) = 0
   - **Time Risk Reason:** Longitudinal time to collision is 0.0 (immediate risk), and lateral time to collision is 2.12 seconds, indicating that there's time to react.
   - **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 0  
   - **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 4
   - **Overall Time Safety Score:** TSC = 0 * 0 + 4 * (1) = 0
   - **Overall Risk Score:** Risk Score = 0.5 * DSC + 0.5 * TSC = 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 0 = 0

3. **Obstacle ID:** 30923
   - **Relative Direction:** Front-left
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** Longitudinal distance to collision is 4.93 and lateral distance is 28.12; both indicate that the risk of collision is moderate.
   - **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 3  
   - **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 5
   - **Overall Distance Safety Score:** DSC = 3 * 0.5 + 5 * (0.5) = 4
   - **Time Risk Reason:** Longitudinal time to collision of 0.68 means it's close to potential impact, while lateral time of 3.91 is more favorable.
   - **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 2  
   - **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 4
   - **Overall Time Safety Score:** TSC = 2 * 0.5 + 4 * (0.5) = 3
   - **Overall Risk Score:** Risk Score = 0.5 * DSC + 0.5 * TSC = 0.5 * 4 + 0.5 * 3 = 3.5, which rounds down to 3
