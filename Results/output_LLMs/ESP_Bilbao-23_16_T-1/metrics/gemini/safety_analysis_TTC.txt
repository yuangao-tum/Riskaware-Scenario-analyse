Safety analysis for timestep 5.0 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.0 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30921
- Relative Direction: Left
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0.0, indicating a collision risk longitudinally. DTClat is 1.1, posing a medium risk laterally. Since the relative direction is Left, the lateral distance is dominant.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.0
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.0, indicating a collision risk longitudinally. TTClat is 0.15, indicating an extreme risk laterally. Since the relative direction is Left, the lateral time is dominant.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 1
- Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
- Overall Risk Score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30922
- Relative Direction: Left
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0.0, indicating a collision risk longitudinally.  DTClat is 14.61, indicating negligible risk laterally. Since the relative direction is Left, the lateral distance is dominant.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.0, indicating a collision risk longitudinally. TTClat is 2.12, indicating a medium risk laterally. Since the relative direction is Left, the lateral time is dominant.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 3
- Overall Time Safety Score: 3.0
- Overall Risk Score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30923
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 4.93, indicating a low risk longitudinally. DTClat is 28.12, indicating a negligible risk laterally. Since the relative direction is Front-left, both longitudinal and lateral distances contribute equally.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.68, indicating a high risk longitudinally. TTClat is 3.91, indicating a low risk laterally. Since the relative direction is Front-left, both longitudinal and lateral times contribute equally.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 2
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 4
- Overall Time Safety Score: 3.0
- Overall Risk Score: 4
