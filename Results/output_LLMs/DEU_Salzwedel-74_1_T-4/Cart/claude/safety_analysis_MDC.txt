Safety analysis for the last timestep (7.4 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario and evaluate collision risks.

### Key Observations:
1. Ego vehicle is in lanelet 1040 moving at approximately 8.7 m/s
2. Several vehicles are in the same lanelet (1040) or adjacent lanelets
3. Most relevant obstacles for collision risk assessment:
   - Obstacle 20067: Following closely in same lanelet
   - Obstacle 20071: Ahead in same lanelet
   - Obstacle 20058: In adjacent lanelet 1039

### Safety Analysis:

For Obstacle 20067:
- Distance Risk reason: Vehicle is directly behind ego in same lanelet with closing distance
- Distance safety score: 2 (High risk due to small longitudinal gap)
- Time Risk reason: Similar velocity but gradually closing gap
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium risk due to reasonable TTC)
- Overall Risk score: 2

For Obstacle 20071:
- Distance Risk reason: Vehicle ahead in same lanelet, maintaining safe distance
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low risk due to adequate spacing)
- Time Risk reason: Similar velocity, stable gap
- Time safety score: 4 (Low risk due to large TTC)
- Overall Risk score: 4

For Obstacle 20058:
- Distance Risk reason: In adjacent lanelet with sufficient lateral separation
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium risk due to parallel movement)
- Time Risk reason: Stable lateral separation maintained
- Time safety score: 4 (Low risk due to predictable trajectory)
- Overall Risk score: 3

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

No immediate collisions or extreme risks are detected. The closest vehicle (20067) maintains sufficient distance despite being in the same lanelet. All identified risks are at manageable levels (scores 2 or higher). The ego vehicle's trajectory appears stable and safe given the current traffic conditions.

The main points of caution are:
1. Monitoring the closing gap with vehicle 20067 behind
2. Maintaining awareness of parallel traffic (20058)
3. Keeping safe following distance from vehicle 20071 ahead
