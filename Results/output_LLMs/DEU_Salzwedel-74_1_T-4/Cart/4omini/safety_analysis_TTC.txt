Safety analysis for the last timestep (7.4 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 7.4: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 20039.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Ego vehicle is in lanelet 1040 and the obstacle is stationary. The distance is far enough to maintain safety.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The ego vehicle is approaching at a low speed, but with a stationary obstacle, the TTC is sufficient (>5s) to react.
   - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 20041.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The ego vehicle is almost aligned with this stationary obstacle but is far enough away.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Similar reasons as above; sufficient TTC with no relative motion threatening collision.
   - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 20042.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: This is another stationary obstacle directly in the lanelet, but significantly distant.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Very low TTC risk since itâ€™s stationary, giving ample time to avoid.
   - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 20045.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is moving toward the ego slightly but is still at a safe distance.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Low velocity, and combined with the distance, results in acceptable TTC.
   - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 20049.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is also moving but does not pose an imminent threat as the distance is acceptable.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Sufficient TTC due to the relatively low speed. 
   - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID: 20053.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: This moving obstacle is at a safe distance yet still in the lanelet.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: TTC is adequate, no imminent threat present.
   - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

7. **Obstacle ID: 20055.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Another moving obstacle situated far from the ego vehicle.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Adequate TTC, enough time for reaction.
   - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

8. **Obstacle ID: 20060.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Even though this obstacle is moving toward the ego vehicle, it starts off at a safe distance.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Valid TTC with enough time for appropriate maneuvers.
   - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

9. **Obstacle ID: 20067.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: It is quite distant and, despite its speed being above average, does not pose a serious collision risk at this moment.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Adequate separation permits a risk-free scenario with time to react.
   - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

10. **Obstacle ID: 20071.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: This is a distant moving obstacle with a significant separation from the ego vehicle.
    - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: TTC is managed; delay or reaction time is sufficient.
    - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
``` 

### In conclusion:
All analyzed obstacles present a Low Risk score, indicating no immediate threat of collision in the scenario provided. The distances and TTC conjoin to mitigate extreme danger, encouraging a controlled response from the ego vehicle.
