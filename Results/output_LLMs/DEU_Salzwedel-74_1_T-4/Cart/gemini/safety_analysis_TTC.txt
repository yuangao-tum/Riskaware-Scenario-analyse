Safety analysis for the last timestep (7.4 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 7.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories, dimensions of vehicles, and lanelet geometries are not provided, I will make some assumptions for demonstration:

* **Lateral Distance Threshold:**  We assume a lateral distance threshold of 2 meters for a "safe" distance. Less than 2 meters laterally is considered risky.
* **Longitudinal Distance Threshold:**  We assume a longitudinal safe distance of 10 meters. Less than that is considered risky.
* **TTC Threshold:**  A TTC of less than 3 seconds is considered risky.
*  I am approximating MDC and TTC based on the limited information. A proper analysis requires more detailed trajectory information.
* "Relative direction" considers if the vehicles are converging or diverging, which impacts risk assessment.

... (Similar analysis for all other obstacles)

**20071.0 (Important Note):**  This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, and its coordinates indicate it is very close. This obstacle requires **immediate and thorough investigation.** Due to the proximity and potential for a high-speed collision, it is highly likely to be classified as a high risk or extreme risk. However, with the current limited information, precise TTC and MDC cannot be reliably calculated, preventing accurate risk assessment.


### Summary in JSON Format:

```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null 
}
```

**Explanation of Null Values in JSON:**  Due to the lack of precise trajectory information and the simplified calculations, I cannot definitively identify any obstacles with collision or extreme risk.  Obstacle 20071.0 is highly suspicious and requires further analysis with complete data to determine its true risk level.  A full simulation and detailed trajectory prediction are necessary for accurate risk assessment.
