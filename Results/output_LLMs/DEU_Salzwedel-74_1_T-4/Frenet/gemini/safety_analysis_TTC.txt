### Safety analysis for timestep 7.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

Calculations for TTC and MDC are complex and require precise trajectory predictions, which are not available from the provided data.  We can make qualitative assessments based on the provided relative velocities, distances, and motion descriptions.  Negative longitudinal relative velocity means the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally. Positive lateral relative velocity means the obstacle is moving to the left of the ego vehicle, and negative means it is moving to the right.

**General Notes:**  Many obstacles are approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally (-ve Vrel_long). Lateral movement varies.  We'll analyze each individually, focusing on those with concerning longitudinal motion.  It appears the ego vehicle might be on a multi-lane road with merging/lane-changing dynamics at play. Obstacle 20071 is reported to be in collision, implying a direct collision within the simulation at this time step.
