### Safety analysis for timestep 3.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**General Notes:**  Lateral movement is generally less critical than longitudinal movement, especially when lateral distances are significant.  The provided data suggests the ego vehicle and most obstacles are on parallel paths with minimal lateral relative velocity, reducing lateral collision risk.  Therefore, longitudinal TTC and distance are prioritized in the risk assessment.  A negative longitudinal TTC indicates the vehicles are moving away from each other in the longitudinal direction.

**Methodology:**

For longitudinal TTC (TTClong), we use a simplified calculation:  TTClong = -DTClong / Vrel_long. This assumes constant relative velocity, which is a reasonable approximation for short durations. It is important to recognize that with constant velocity, TTClat is often not relevant when objects are parallel in their motion direction, as lateral distance remains static. For these cases, lateral risks can occur from lane changes and lateral acceleration. In the following scenario, we notice that all lateral acceleration and lateral speed values are relatively low. Thus, we assign the time risk score based solely on the longitudinal time to collision value. A more refined calculation incorporating acceleration could be used if more precise results are needed. For MDC, we rely on the information given by DTClat, where we look at the smallest absolute distance between ego and other vehicles. In this case, the smallest distance is still considered to be safe.
