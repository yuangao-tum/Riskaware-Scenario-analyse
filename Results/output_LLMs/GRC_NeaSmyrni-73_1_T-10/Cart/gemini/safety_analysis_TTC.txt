Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since the provided scenario lacks crucial information like obstacle dimensions, lanelet widths, and precise trajectories, I'll make reasonable assumptions for demonstration:

* **Circular Obstacle Approximation:**  Obstacles are treated as points for simplicity in distance calculations.  A more realistic analysis would require bounding boxes.
* **Constant Velocity:** Obstacle and ego vehicle velocities are assumed constant for TTC approximation.  This is a simplification, especially given the ego vehicle's acceleration.
* **Lanelet-Based Risk:** Obstacles in different lanelets are generally considered lower risk unless their trajectories intersect with the ego vehicle's path.

**Calculations:**

Distance To Collision (DTC) will be calculated using the Euclidean distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle.
Time To Collision (TTC) will be calculated as DTC / Relative Velocity if applicable. If the objects are predicted to move away, TTC will not be computed and the risk would be considered negligible.
Relative Velocity will be considered for objects in the same lanelet or predicted to soon be in the same lanelet if applicable. For simplicity, we'll assume that objects in different lanelets have no relative velocity with each other.



### Obstacle Analysis:

* **General Note:** Most obstacles are in different lanelets and are stationary.  Without trajectory information, they present negligible risk *unless* they are extremely close to the ego vehicle's current lanelet.

* **Obstacle ID: 20056**
    - Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet as Ego's predicted path with the given Ego's velocity, and relatively close, but still has safe distance.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Given Ego's current velocity and its deceleration, and the obstacle's velocity and its deceleration, they are likely to collide in the near future.
    - Time safety score: 2
    - Overall Risk score: 2

* **Obstacle ID: 20061**
    - Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet as Ego's predicted path with the given Ego's velocity and relatively close.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Moving towards Ego at a moderately high speed. The closing speed poses a high risk in the near future.
    - Time safety score: 2
    - Overall Risk score: 2


* **Obstacle ID: 20089**
    - Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and very close.
    - Distance safety score: 3
    - Time Risk reason: Obstacle is slow-moving, collision risk is medium.
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3

* **Obstacle ID: 20090**
    - Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and very close.
    - Distance safety score: 3
    - Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moderately fast moving, collision risk is medium.
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3

* **Obstacle ID: 20100**
    - Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, but far behind; no immediate risk.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason:  Moving faster than ego vehicle and hence the distance is increasing, very low collision probability.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

* **Obstacle ID: 20104**
    - Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet, but ahead of the ego vehicle.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Moving faster than the ego vehicle and further increasing the distance.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5


* **All Other Obstacles:**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located in different lanelets and far from the ego vehicleâ€™s current position.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Stationary or no trajectory conflict is apparent; very low collision probability.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5
