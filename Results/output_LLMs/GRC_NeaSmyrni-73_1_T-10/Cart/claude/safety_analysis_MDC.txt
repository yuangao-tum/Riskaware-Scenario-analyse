Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.7 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario for collision risks between the ego vehicle and obstacles.

### Safety Analysis:

1. **Ego Vehicle Position and Movement**:
   - Located in lanelet 1033.0 with decreasing velocity from 12.16 m/s to 3.98 m/s
   - Moving with orientation around 2.02 radians
   - Significant deceleration observed

2. **Relevant Obstacles Analysis**:

**Obstacle 20096**:
- Distance Risk reason: Moving in similar direction, with closest approach at later timesteps
- Distance safety score: 3 (Moderate risk due to parallel trajectories)
- Time Risk reason: Maintaining safe distance with controlled relative velocity
- Time safety score: 4 (Low risk due to stable relative motion)
- Overall Risk score: 4

**Obstacle 20100**:
- Distance Risk reason: In same lanelet, following similar trajectory
- Distance safety score: 3 (Moderate risk due to shared path)
- Time Risk reason: Maintaining safe separation distance
- Time safety score: 4 (Low risk with controlled relative speed)
- Overall Risk score: 4

**Obstacle 20104**:
- Distance Risk reason: In same lanelet but further ahead
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low risk due to sufficient distance)
- Time Risk reason: Moving with similar velocity, maintaining gap
- Time safety score: 4 (Low risk due to stable relative motion)
- Overall Risk score: 4

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Key Findings:
1. The ego vehicle is maintaining safe distances from all obstacles
2. The ego vehicle's deceleration helps increase safety margins
3. No immediate collision risks detected
4. Objects in the same lanelet maintain sufficient separation
5. Relative velocities are well controlled

The overall scenario shows proper safety management with no extreme risks or imminent collisions. The ego vehicle's controlled deceleration helps maintain safe distances from other vehicles in the same lanelet.
