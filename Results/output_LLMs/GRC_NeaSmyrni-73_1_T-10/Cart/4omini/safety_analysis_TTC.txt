Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.7 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 20001**
   - Distance Risk reason: The ego vehicle is located in lanelet 1033.0 and the obstacle is in lanelet 1707.0. Given the significant distance (approximately 78.9 units) and the fact the obstacle is stationary, it presents minimal risk.
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: With the ego vehicle moving at a velocity of 3.9771 units and the obstacle stationary, the time to any potential collision approaches effectively zero in this trajectory. However, since they are in different lanelets, the risk is negligible.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 4

2. **Obstacle ID: 20002**
   - Distance Risk reason: Similar to Obstacle 20001, this obstacle is also stationary and far away (approximately 79.0 units) from the ego vehicle's position. 
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: Again, as the obstacle is stationary and far, the risk across different trajectories manifests as negligible, leading to a good TTC value.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 4 

3. **Obstacle ID: 20003**
   - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is at a safe distance of around 80.8 units, correlating with minimal collision risk.
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: Same principles apply, with a substantial distance to cover before any risk of collision appears.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 4

4. **Obstacle ID: 20004**
   - Distance Risk reason: Located 83.0 units away, the distance indicates very low collision potential.
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: As this obstacle is also stationary, the TTC is significantly in favor of the ego vehicle if it continues its current trajectory.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 4 

5. **Obstacle ID: 20005**
   - Distance Risk reason: Yet another stationary obstacle at 82.8 units poses minimal risk.
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: With the same analyses as above, the relative position ensures the risk remains minimal.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 4 

6. **Obstacle ID: 20006**
   - Distance Risk reason: This one too provides at least 81.5 units of clearance, ensuring low collision risk.
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: Again, both the distance and static nature of the obstacle indicate negligible TTC risk.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 4 

7. **Obstacle ID: 20007**
   - Distance Risk reason: Positioned more than 80 units away, same reasoning applies here; no real collision risk.
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: As the obstacle is not in the same lanelet and thus presents no collision path, time risk is also negligible.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 4 

8. **Obstacle ID: 20008**
   - Distance Risk reason: Occupying a position akin to the other stationary obstacles, the distance ensures minimal risk.
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: Same rationale applies: stationary, far enough away, hence significant time to any potential collision.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 4 

9. **Obstacle ID: 20009**
   - Distance Risk reason: Distance remains far, keeping the overall collision risk low.
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: As a stationary obstacle, the potential to collide remains non-existent within immediate timeframes.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 4 

10. **Obstacle ID: 20010**
    - Distance Risk reason: Similarly placed at a significant distance. 
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: The situation maintains its previous conclusions regarding the static nature and distance.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 4 

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```
### Overall Conclusion:
No obstacles present a collision risk or an extreme risk under the analyzed conditions described for the ego vehicle's current state and position. All obstacles remain well clear of the collision path indicated by travelled distances and currently observed dynamics.
