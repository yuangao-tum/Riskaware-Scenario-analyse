Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 20056.0**  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is relatively closer compared to some others; however, it's still at a moderately safe distance both longitudinally and laterally from the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity and negative acceleration mean itâ€™s unlikely to intrude rapidly into the ego path.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20100.0**  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is in the same lanelet (1033.0) and on a similar trajectory, implying a shared path; however, sufficient distance exists.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Higher speed indicates the possibility of closing distance, but current TTC values suggest manageable time for correction.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 20104.0**  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in the same trajectory (lanelet 1033.0), with a closer proximity compared to other obstacles longitudinally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity could reduce TTC significantly if acceleration increases, warranting moderate alertness.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

The remaining obstacles are mostly stationary with zero velocity, located in different lanelets, or are significantly distanced both longitudinally and laterally from the ego vehicle. Therefore, the risk is minimal with distance safety scores of 5 and time safety scores of 5, resulting in an overall risk score of 5 for each.
