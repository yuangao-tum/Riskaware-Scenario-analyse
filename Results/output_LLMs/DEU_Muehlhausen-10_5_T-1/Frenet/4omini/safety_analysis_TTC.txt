### Safety analysis for timestep 1.2 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID**: 32.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 25.46m and lateral distance is 6.97m. The obstacle is closer in the longitudinal direction, posing a risk as it is driving toward the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The longitudinal relative velocity is -5.04m/s. This indicates that the obstacle will reach the ego vehicle in approximately 5.04m / 5.04m/s = 5.03 seconds. Lateral movement doesn't directly affect, so it seems manageable.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID**: 39.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinally 45.22m away and laterally aligned (0.0m), with the obstacle moving away longitudinally. 
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is positive longitudinally (6.4m/s), indicating increasing distance. Hence, no risk of collision is noticed.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID**: 311.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is 16.23m longitudinally and 3.22m laterally closer, posing a potential risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance will close at a rate of 2.31m/s; thus, TTC is 16.23m / 2.31m/s = 7.03 seconds, making it manageable.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID**: 315.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is directly at the same position as the ego vehicle, presenting an immediate collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative longitudinal velocity of 4.07m/s means it's moving into the exact path, leading to imminent collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 

- **Obstacle ID**: 321.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance of 23.92m longitudinally and 38.72m laterally poses a manageable risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Similar to previous obstacles, with a relative longitudinal velocity of -5.62m/s, the estimated TTC is 23.92m / 5.62m/s ≈ 4.25 seconds, making it manageable.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID**: 324.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is relatively close at 21.44m longitudinally and 4.37m laterally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The longitudinal velocity of -5.74m/s leads to a TTC of 21.44m / 5.74m/s ≈ 3.74 seconds; thus collision remains possible.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID**: 331.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is 19.2m behind, posing no immediate risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Even though it is moving towards the ego vehicle, the lateral components don’t affect the risk at this distance.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID**: 341.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is farther behind at 35.88m, creating a negligible risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: This obstacle is moving away, contributing to the absence of collision risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID**: 357.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal gap is 44.3m but the obstacle is moving towards the car in the lateral direction, adding to complexity.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The longitudinal velocity of -5.87m/s indicates an extent of TTC, manageable with timely action.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID**: 360.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at 55.65m longitudinally with 1.43m laterally, creating negligible immediate risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Moving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally gives a safe buffer distance of time for reaction.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4
