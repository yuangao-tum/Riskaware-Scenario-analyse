### Safety analysis for timestep 1.2: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 32.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the front-left with a moderate longitudinal distance of 25.46 m and a lateral distance of 6.97 m. It is approaching the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: With a longitudinal relative velocity of -5.04 m/s, the Time to Collision (TTC) can be calculated as approximately 5.05 seconds in the longitudinal direction. The lateral velocity of -1.09 m/s implies a safe lateral TTC of about 6.39 seconds.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 39.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is directly in front, with a safe longitudinal distance of 45.22 m and no lateral offset.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The object is moving away with a longitudinal velocity of 6.4 m/s, indicating an increasing safe distance over time.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 311.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the front-right at a moderate longitudinal distance of 16.23 m and a lateral distance of -3.22 m. It is moving away.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Its longitudinal velocity is 2.31 m/s, moving away, leading to a negligible time risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 315.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is at the same position as the ego vehicle (collision). With 0 m longitudinal and lateral distance.
  - **Distance safety score**: 0 (Collision)
  - **Time Risk reason**: With no relative movement, the TTC is effectively 0.
  - **Time safety score**: 0 (Collision)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 321.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned front-left, it has a longitudinal distance of 23.92 m and lateral distance of 38.72 m. It is moving towards the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: With a longitudinal velocity of -5.62 m/s, the TTC is approximately 4.26 seconds. Lateral movement is slower with less risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 324.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned front-right, with a longitudinal distance of 21.44 m and lateral distance of -4.37 m. Moving towards the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal velocity of -5.74 m/s suggests a TTC of about 3.73 seconds.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 331.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is behind with longitudinal distance -19.2 m, approaching the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal velocity of 2.01 m/s is modest, with a low risk for immediate collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 341.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned behind, longitudinal distance of -35.88 m and moving away.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Relative longitudinal velocity -0.51 m/s further increases safe distance over time.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 357.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned front-left, with a longitudinal distance of 44.3 m and lateral offset of 1.56 m. The obstacle is approaching longitudinally, but moving away laterally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The longitudinal approach velocity of -5.87 m/s indicates a TTC of approximately 7.54 seconds.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 360.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned front-left, with safe longitudinal 55.65 m, approaching longitudinally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The longitudinal approach velocity of -6.99 m/s gives a TTC of around 7.96 seconds.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4
