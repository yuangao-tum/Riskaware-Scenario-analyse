### Safety analysis for timestep 1.2 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 32.0  
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance is 25.46 m, and lateral distance is 6.97 m. The obstacle is moving toward the ego car from the front-left, which suggests an increasing risk of intersection.  
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)  
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC: 5.04 m/s / 5.04 = 5.0 s and lateral TTC: 6.97 m / 1.09 m/s = 6.39 s. More than sufficient time before potential collision.  
  - Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk)  
  - Overall Risk score: **4** (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 39.0  
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal 45.22 m and lateral 0.0 m. The obstacle is moving away, indicating no immediate risk of collision.  
  - Distance safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)  
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC remains large given the obstacle is moving away.  
  - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)  
  - Overall Risk score: **5** (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 311.0  
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance of 16.23 m and lateral distance of -3.22 m. The obstacle is moving away but close enough to monitor for potential risks.  
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)  
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC: 16.23 m / 2.31 m/s ≈ 7.02 s and lateral TTC is not applicable as the obstacle is moving away.  
  - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)  
  - Overall Risk score: **4** (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 315.0  
  - Distance Risk reason: At 0.0 m longitudinally and laterally, the ego car is in collision with this obstacle.  
  - Distance safety score: **0** (Collision)  
  - Time Risk reason: Immediate collision as it is already at 0 m distance.  
  - Time safety score: **0** (Collision)  
  - Overall Risk score: **0** (Collision)

- **Obstacle ID:** 321.0  
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 23.92 m and lateral distance is 38.72 m. Moving toward the vehicle but not dangerously close yet.  
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)  
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal: 23.92 m / 5.62 m/s = 4.26 s and lateral is sufficient.  
  - Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk)  
  - Overall Risk score: **4** (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 324.0  
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance of 21.44 m and lateral distance of -4.37 m. Moving toward the vehicle, which warrants attention but not immediately threatening.  
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)  
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC is about 21.44 m / 5.74 m/s ≈ 3.73 s, manageable with timely acknowledgment.  
  - Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk)  
  - Overall Risk score: **4** (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 331.0  
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance of -19.2 m indicates the obstacle is approaching from behind, thus not a consideration for frontal collision.  
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)  
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC is not calculable; represents more of a monitoring concern.  
  - Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk)  
  - Overall Risk score: **4** (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 341.0  
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance of -35.88 m, moving away from the ego vehicle, creating no immediate risk.  
  - Distance safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)  
  - Time Risk reason: TTC is also not applicable.  
  - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)  
  - Overall Risk score: **5** (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 357.0  
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance of 44.3 m and lateral distance of 1.56 m indicates an approaching obstacle but not too close yet.  
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)  
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC is generally safe: about 7.53 s based on speed disparity.  
  - Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk)  
  - Overall Risk score: **4** (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 360.0  
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance of 55.65 m and lateral distance of 1.43 m indicates a safe distance but appears to be approaching.  
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)  
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC is about 8.0 s, indicating safety.  
  - Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk)  
  - Overall Risk score: **4** (Low Risk)
