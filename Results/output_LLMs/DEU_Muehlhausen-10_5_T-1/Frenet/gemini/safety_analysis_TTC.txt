### Safety analysis for timestep 1.2s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 32.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Moderately far, but approaching laterally and longitudinally. Front-left position presents a potential risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching, requiring attention.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 39.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far away in front and moving away longitudinally.  Lateral motion uncertain but not immediately concerning given the longitudinal distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, minimizing risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 311.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close, but moving away in both directions. Front-right location poses reduced risk due to diverging trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away, reducing risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 315.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Collision imminent (0 distance).
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Collision imminent.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 321.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Farther away than 32.0 but still approaching longitudinally and laterally from the front-left. Requires monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching, needs attention.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 324.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively close and approaching longitudinally from front-right. Lateral movement towards ego vehicle warrants attention.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Approaching fast, higher risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 331.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close behind but moving away longitudinally. Lateral alignment not a concern currently.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, reducing risk. Not a direct threat given its position.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 341.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Far behind and moving away, posing no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving further away, not a concern.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


**- Obstacle ID: 357.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far and slightly to the front-left, but approaching longitudinally.  Lateral motion away from ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching but less concerning given the distance and lateral motion.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 360.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Furthest obstacle, located in front-left and approaching longitudinally, but lateral motion away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Approaching but presents negligible risk due to large distance and lateral motion.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
