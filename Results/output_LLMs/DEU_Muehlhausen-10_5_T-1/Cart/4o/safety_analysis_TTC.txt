Safety analysis for the last timestep (1.2 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 1.2: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 32.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is in lanelet 6094.0, which is not same as ego vehicle's lanelet. Its relative positioning and low velocity reduce the immediate risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is moving at a low velocity with substantial lateral separation from the ego vehicle, minimizing time risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 39.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is in lanelet 4504.0, different from the ego vehicle, moving quickly but away from direct collision path.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Fast-moving but positioned away to the lateral side; time to collision is not a concern.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 311.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned in a different lanelet and moving rapidly, sufficient distance to manage safety.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** High velocity contributes to negligible time risk as trajectory diverges from the ego vehicle.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 315.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Co-located in lanelet 4507.0 as the ego vehicle, faster velocity but situated behind the ego.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Shared lanelet increases time risk; however, its position relative to ego allows reaction time.
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 321.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Located in a separate lanelet with significantly distributed positioning to the lateral side.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Low velocity and diverging path significantly lower the time collision risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 324.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Different lanelet, low velocity, and no immediate path crossing minimize collision probability.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Minimal time collision risk due to different lane and slow movement.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 331.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** In the same lanelet (4507.0) but shares adequate buffer distance and ongoing speed.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Higher speed than ego but distance available for maneuvering reduces urgency.
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 341.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Co-located in lanelet 4507.0 but with sufficient distance behind.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Although same lanelet, it's distanced enough that the time to collision is negligible.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 357.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned in lanelet 4505.0, away from the egoâ€™s immediate trajectory path.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Due to low speed and separate lanelet, time risk remains negligible.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 360.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Also in lanelet 4505.0, positioned laterally away, moving slowly.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** In light of its slow velocity and lateral displacement, time risk is negligible.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
