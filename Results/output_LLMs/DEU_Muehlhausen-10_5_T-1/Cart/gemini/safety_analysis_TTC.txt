Safety analysis for the last timestep (1.2 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 1.2s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories, dimensions of vehicles, and lateral movement capabilities are not provided, a simplified approach is taken. We assume a rectangular bounding box for each vehicle and primarily focus on longitudinal TTC and distance.  Lateral risk is qualitatively assessed based on lanelet information and relative positions. A more precise analysis would require additional data.  A safety buffer distance is also assumed for MDC calculations (not explicitly specified, assumed to be negligible for this example but would be important in a real system).

**Ego Vehicle Information:**
- Position: (-494.38, 124.76)
- Velocity: 5.58 m/s
- Acceleration: -0.63 m/sÂ²
- Lanelet: 4507.0


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 32.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (6094) and laterally separated.  Longitudinal distance is significant.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  No immediate time-based risk due to lane separation and current distance.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 39.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (4504) and laterally separated. Longitudinal distance is moderate.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle has a higher velocity and might approach the ego vehicle longitudinally, but lateral separation reduces the risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 311.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (5853) and laterally separated. Moderate longitudinal distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle has a higher velocity but poses minimal risk due to lateral separation.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 315.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet (4507) and close behind the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle has a higher velocity than the ego vehicle, which is decelerating. High risk of a rear-end collision.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 321.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (4625) and laterally separated. Safe longitudinal distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No immediate time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 324.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (5791) and laterally separated. Relatively close but manageable distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle has a low velocity and poses minimal time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 331.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet (4507) and ahead of the ego vehicle. Safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle has a higher velocity, but a sufficient time to collision is estimated.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 341.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet (4507) and ahead of the ego vehicle. Safe distance.

- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 357.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (4505) and laterally separated.  Moderate longitudinal distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Low velocity and lateral separation mitigate time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 360.0**
