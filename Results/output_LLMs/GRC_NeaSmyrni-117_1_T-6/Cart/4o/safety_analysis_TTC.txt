Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.6 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 20026.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is far and located in a different lanelet. No intersections in the path.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Zero velocity and located in a different lanelet suggest no risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20027.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is far and located in a different lanelet, ensuring no direct path to collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary and in a different lanelet; no collision trajectory.

  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20028.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Shares the same lanelet as ego vehicle, relatively close proximity.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Although stationary, proximity could reduce reaction time if the ego vehicle's course doesn't change.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 20029.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Located much further ahead or sideways, does not pose an immediate risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: While in a different orbit, even lateral movements reduce risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20030.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned far enough in another lanelet. No imminent threat.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Inactivity in a different lanelet suggests low time risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20031.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Well-placed away from the ego's current path.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary, away from immediate path.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20032.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Proximity in the same lanelet could be significant upon movement.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Stationary, but relative distance would lower response time.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 20033.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Substantial distance in another lanelet; non-intrusive.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Stationary in a different track, minimizing time influence.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20034.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The location signifies negligible interaction risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Absence of speed with significant positional advantage.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20035.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Pretty much out of collision corridor.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Static with no immediate reciprocity risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20036.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Closer in the same lanelet but distanced enough.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Stationary close by, suggests the need for alertness.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 20037.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving in the same lanelet, behind the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Some rear motion but manageable with current ego velocity.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20039.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Same lanelet from where the ego vehicle is projected to move.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2
  - **Time Risk reason**: Fast approaching towards the ego's path.
  - **Time safety score**: 2
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2

### Summary in JSON Format

  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

**Conclusions:** Upon analysis, no obstacle currently presents a collision or extreme risk. That said, obstacles within the same lanelet should not be ignored, especially with proximity and relative velocity dynamics. Immediate actions or continued monitoring is advisable, especially for obstacles with a medium risk.
