Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.6 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 20026.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is located at (75.3972, 74.3363) while the ego vehicle is at (-36.8215, -36.2834). The distance is significant; thus, there is no immediate concern for collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Given the velocities, as the obstacle is stationary and the ego vehicle is moving with negative acceleration, the relative velocity direction indicates no risk of collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20027.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Same logic as above. The obstacle located at (80.3682, 79.2367) is far from the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: No collision risk exists as the vehicle approaches, with the obstacle remaining stationary.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20028.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at (-8.3612, -8.2317), this obstacle is somewhat closer than previous obstacles but still poses no immediate risk of collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Since the ego vehicle has a negative velocity, the possibility of collision diminishes significantly.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20029.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle at (8.0375, -8.0732) is moving, but the velocity is zero so it does not pose a collision risk; the gap is sufficient.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Similar reasoning as above, no collision risk due to velocity and distance.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20030.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned further down the trajectory at (12.9022, -13.0798), the distance remains considerable, leading to no collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Again, with time allowance for reactions, no collision is expected.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20031.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (17.765, -18.0852), this obstacle is no threat due to the distance margin.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: No collision expected based on motion parameters.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20032.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Close by at (-13.3326, -13.1317), yet poses minimal collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Similar status prevents any risk of collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20033.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at (26.7093, -27.2919) - safely out of the collision path.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Low likelihood for collision based on current velocities.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20034.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle at (32.9355, -33.7006) poses no clash implications due to the maintained distance.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Similarly, keeping distance eliminates time risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20035.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Not a threat as it is further away (37.8039, -38.7118).
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: The situation remains stable with respect to time.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20036.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: At (-18.3043, -18.0321), the distance encourages safety.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: No collision anticipated with ego vehicle movements.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20037.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Close proximity at (-23.4324, -23.0865) but retains control.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocities manage collision potential.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20039.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: At (-39.692, -39.1128), distance suggests no risk of collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: No risk arises here since the obstacle is also moving.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4
