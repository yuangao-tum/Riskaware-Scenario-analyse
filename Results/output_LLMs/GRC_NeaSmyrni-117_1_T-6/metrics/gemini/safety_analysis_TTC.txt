Safety analysis for timestep 3.6 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20026
- Relative Direction: Front
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong (153.07) > 5, indicating negligible longitudinal risk. DTClat (0.0) indicates a collision course laterally, but given the front direction, longitudinal distance dominates.
