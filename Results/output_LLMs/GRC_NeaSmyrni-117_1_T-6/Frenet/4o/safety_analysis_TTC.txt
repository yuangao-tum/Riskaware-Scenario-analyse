### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 20026.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 153.07 m. There is no lateral distance as itâ€™s in perfect alignment with the ego.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: With a relative velocity of -1.6 m/s (approaching the ego vehicle), the TTC is approximately 95.67 seconds (153.07 / 1.6), which indicates ample time to avoid a collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20027.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Directly in front at 160.05 m longitudinal distance, no lateral offset.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity of -1.6 m/s gives a TTC of 100.03 seconds, allowing for adequate maneuvering time.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20028.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in the lane in front at 35.45 m.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity of -1.6 m/s results in a TTC of approximately 22.16 seconds. This is a moderate risk scenario as the circumstance is manageable but requires attention.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 20029.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Situated in the front-right with a longitudinal distance of 47.25 m and lateral distance of -9.78 m, indicating it is not directly within the path.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC results in a safer scenario given the lateral offset, adjusting attention primarily on maintaining paths.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20030.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned front-right, farther laterally at -16.76 m.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Adequate time and distance contribute to a very safe scenario, given the lateral positioning.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20031.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Even further offset laterally at -23.74 m, minimizing immediate collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: The position well outside the lanelet of the ego car removes any imminent collision threat.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20032.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Close to the ego vehicle with only 28.47 m separating them directly in front.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Requires action due to moderate risk, with TTC of 17.79 seconds.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 20033.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: A substantial lateral offset of -36.57 m ensures no immediate path interference.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: The position negates any time-dependent rush for evasion.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20034.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Lateral position at -45.51 m signifies a minimal threat.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Safe from a collision timetable perspective as well.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20035.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Significantly laterally distanced, outside the potential collision path.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Irrelevant in its distance to the trajectory and path of the ego vehicle.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20036.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Located just 21.49 m ahead, demanding vigilance.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relatively short TTC of 13.43 seconds highlights a need for timely intervention.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 20037.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned critically close at 14.29 m, making it a high-priority risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2
  - **Time Risk reason**: The different relative velocity and acceleration result in a faster convergence risk, needing rapid response.
  - **Time safety score**: 2
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 20039.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Direct collision scenario as the relative distances are zero.
  - **Distance safety score**: 0
  - **Time Risk reason**: Presence indicates the collision has already occurred.
  - **Time safety score**: 0
  - **Overall Risk score**: 0
