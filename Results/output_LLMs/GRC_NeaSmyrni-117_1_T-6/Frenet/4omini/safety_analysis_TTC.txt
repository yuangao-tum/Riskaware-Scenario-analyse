  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 47.15 m, lateral distance is -23.74 m; within an acceptable distance.
  - Distance safety score: 3
  - Time Risk reason: TTC = 47.15 m / 1.6 m/s = 29.48 seconds; enough time to maneuver.
  - Time safety score: 4
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 20032.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 28.47 m, lateral distance is 0.0 m; closer proximity indicates a higher risk.
  - Distance safety score: 2
  - Time Risk reason: TTC = 28.47 m / 1.6 m/s = 17.78 seconds; requires immediate awareness.
  - Time safety score: 3
  - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 20033.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 47.06 m, lateral distance is -36.57 m; farther but slightly to the right.
  - Distance safety score: 3
  - Time Risk reason: TTC = 47.06 m / 1.6 m/s = 29.41 seconds; indicates sufficient time for avoidance.
  - Time safety score: 4
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 20034.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 46.99 m, lateral distance is -45.51 m; acceptable distance.
  - Distance safety score: 3
  - Time Risk reason: TTC = 46.99 m / 1.6 m/s = 29.37 seconds; enough time to take corrective actions.
  - Time safety score: 4
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 20035.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 46.94 m, lateral distance is -52.5 m; poses minimal risk given the distance.
  - Distance safety score: 3
  - Time Risk reason: TTC = 46.94 m / 1.6 m/s = 29.35 seconds; gives a reasonable time frame to react.
  - Time safety score: 4
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 20036.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 21.49 m, lateral distance is 0.0 m; closer proximity thus higher risk.
  - Distance safety score: 2
  - Time Risk reason: TTC = 21.49 m / 1.6 m/s = 13.43 seconds; requires prompt response.
  - Time safety score: 3
  - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 20037.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 14.29 m, lateral distance is 0.0 m; very close proximity indicates a high risk.
  - Distance safety score: 1
  - Time Risk reason: TTC = 14.29 m / 1.09 m/s â‰ˆ 13.13 seconds; immediate action is required.
  - Time safety score: 2
  - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 20039.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The ego vehicle is at the same position as the obstacle; collision is imminent.
