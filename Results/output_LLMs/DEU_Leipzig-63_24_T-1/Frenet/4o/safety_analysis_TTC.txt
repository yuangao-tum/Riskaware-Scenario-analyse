### Safety Analysis for Timestep 5.3: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3253**
  - Distance Risk reason: Closest in trajectory with only 2.88 m longitudinal distance and no relative lateral motion.
  - Distance safety score: <Medium Risk (3)>
  - Time Risk reason: Minimal relative velocity, resulting in a very high TTC.
  - Time safety score: <Low Risk (4)>
  - Overall Risk score: <Medium Risk (3)>

- **Obstacle ID: 3254**
  - Distance Risk reason: Far lateral distance and moving away in both directions.
  - Distance safety score: <Negligible Risk (5)>
  - Time Risk reason: Positive longitudinal velocity indicating increasing separation.
  - Time safety score: <Negligible Risk (5)>
  - Overall Risk score: <Negligible Risk (5)>

- **Obstacle ID: 3255**
  - Distance Risk reason: Close distance, similar to 3253, with no lateral motion.
  - Distance safety score: <Medium Risk (3)>
  - Time Risk reason: Minimal relative velocity, resulting in a very high TTC.
  - Time safety score: <Low Risk (4)>
  - Overall Risk score: <Medium Risk (3)>

- **Obstacle ID: 3256**
  - Distance Risk reason: Moderate longitudinal distance, moving toward the ego car.
  - Distance safety score: <Medium Risk (3)>
  - Time Risk reason: Negative velocity increasing collision risk longitudinally.
  - Time safety score: <Medium Risk (3)>
  - Overall Risk score: <Medium Risk (3)>

- **Obstacle ID: 3257**
  - Distance Risk reason: Significant longitudinal distance but approaching rapidly.
  - Distance safety score: <Medium Risk (3)>
  - Time Risk reason: High negative longitudinal velocity decreases TTC significantly.
  - Time safety score: <High Risk (2)>
  - Overall Risk score: <High Risk (2)>

- **Obstacle ID: 3261**
  - Distance Risk reason: Exact zero distance and alignments depicting an immediate collision.
  - Distance safety score: <Extreme Risk (0)>
  - Time Risk reason: Already in collision state.
  - Time safety score: <Extreme Risk (0)>
  - Overall Risk score: <Extreme Risk (0)>

- **Obstacle ID: 3262**
  - Distance Risk reason: Moderate longitudinal distance; however, has significant lateral separation.
  - Distance safety score: <Medium Risk (3)>
  - Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally and laterally.
  - Time safety score: <Medium Risk (3)>
  - Overall Risk score: <Medium Risk (3)>

- **Obstacle ID: 3263**
  - Distance Risk reason: Relatively close in longitudinal direction, moderate lateral separation.
  - Distance safety score: <Medium Risk (3)>
  - Time Risk reason: Negligible relative velocity maintains a higher TTC.
  - Time safety score: <Low Risk (4)>
  - Overall Risk score: <Medium Risk (3)>

- **Obstacle ID: 3264**
  - Distance Risk reason: Very far longitudinal distance; thus negligible risk.
  - Distance safety score: <Negligible Risk (5)>
  - Time Risk reason: Significant negative velocity leads to significant TTC but highly probable to avoid given distance.
  - Time safety score: <Low Risk (4)>
  - Overall Risk score: <Low Risk (4)>

- **Obstacle ID: 3265**
  - Distance Risk reason: Exact zero longitudinal distance but lateral separation mitigates immediate collision risk.
  - Distance safety score: <Medium Risk (3)>
  - Time Risk reason: Rapid separation laterally reduces collision probability.
  - Time safety score: <Low Risk (4)>
  - Overall Risk score: <Medium Risk (3)>

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "3261",
    "OverallRiskScore": "0"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

### Conclusion:
Obstacle 3261 is the immediate concern due to existing contact with the ego vehicle (CollisionObstacle). Other obstacles present various risk levels, with Obstacle 3257 having the highest risk of potential future collision (High Risk), but none fall into the extreme category as per provided data.
