### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 3253.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively close longitudinally (2.88m) and laterally (5.58m) in the front-left zone.  
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Almost stationary relative longitudinal velocity (-0.03 m/s) implies a high TTClong if the slight acceleration away from the ego car continues. No lateral relative motion.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 3254.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Safe distance longitudinally (9.04m) and laterally (44.89m) and moving away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away both longitudinally and laterally.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 3255.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively close longitudinally (4.02m) and laterally (23.78m) in the front-left zone.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Almost stationary relative longitudinal velocity (-0.03 m/s). No lateral motion.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 3256.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Laterally close (8.51m) while longitudinally at a safer distance (15.23m), but driving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Closing longitudinally and laterally.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 3257.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Laterally close (5.81m) but longitudinally at a safer distance (28.14m).
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching quickly longitudinally (-4.37 m/s) but moving away laterally. The positive longitudinal acceleration might avert a collision.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 3261.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Collision imminent (0m longitudinal and lateral distance).
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Already in collision.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 3262.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively close longitudinally (5.66m) and in the front-left zone, though laterally far (46.82m), but moving towards the ego vehicle laterally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally and laterally.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 3263.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Longitudinally close (3.61m) and in the front-right zone, with moderate lateral distance (12.57m).
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Almost stationary longitudinally with no lateral relative motion.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 3264.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Longitudinally far (113.94m) and almost directly ahead (0.48m lateral distance).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching quickly longitudinally (-9.25 m/s), but the distance provides ample time to react. Moving away laterally.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


**- Obstacle ID: 3265.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Laterally moderately far (20.74 m) to the right.  Longitudinally aligned with the ego car.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving away laterally but almost stationary longitudinally.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
