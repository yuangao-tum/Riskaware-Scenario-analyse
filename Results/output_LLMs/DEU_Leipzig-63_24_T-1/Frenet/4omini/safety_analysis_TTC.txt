### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 3253.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance (2.88 m) is quite close, indicating proximity to collision, while the lateral distance is significant (5.58 m). Given that it is moving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally, there is a noticeable risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative longitudinal velocity is -0.03 m/s, indicating a slow approach. The TTC (calculated as distance/speed) is not below critical levels, but it suggests a need for quick attention.
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 3254.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance (9.04 m) is moderate and increasing laterally away from the ego vehicle. This mitigates concerns about imminent collision.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle, indicating increasing distance and therefore a low likelihood of collision.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 3255.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance (4.02 m) indicates closeness, and it is moving toward the ego vehicle, increasing risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: With a relative velocity of -0.03 m/s, there is limited closure, but caution is advised.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 3256.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance (15.23 m) is decent but combined with lateral proximity (8.51 m), this poses a risk as it is approaching from both dimensions.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: With longitudinal and lateral movement toward the ego vehicle, the collision potential is still considerable despite being at some distance.
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 3257.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance (28.14 m) suggests this obstacle is not an immediate concern, despite it approaching longitudinally.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity indicates a significant approach rate but this is offset by the noted distance.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID: 3261.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is at a 0.0 m distance in both longitudinal and lateral directions, indicating an exact point of collision.
   - **Distance safety score**: 0 (Collision Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: With such proximity, the collision is imminent regardless of relative velocities.
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 0 (Collision Risk)

7. **Obstacle ID: 3262.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle (5.66m in front and laterally at 46.82m) indicates moderate risk as it approaches.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Both longitudinal and lateral movement toward the vehicle further elevates caution.
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

8. **Obstacle ID: 3263.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance (3.61 m) indicates that this vehicle is relatively close, posing a risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The negative relative velocity indicates minimal movement leading to potential impact.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

9. **Obstacle ID: 3264.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: A longitudinal distance of 113.94 m minimizes immediate concern, facilitating high safety.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The motion indicates the vehicle is moving away and at a safe distance, resulting in no collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

10. **Obstacle ID: 3265.0**
    - **Distance Risk reason**: At 0.0 m longitudinal distance, this obstacle is in an exact collision position with the ego vehicle.
    - **Distance safety score**: 0 (Collision Risk)
    - **Time Risk reason**: The current proximity indicates immediate collision in both longitudinal and lateral dimensions.
    - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
    - **Overall Risk score**: 0 (Collision Risk)
