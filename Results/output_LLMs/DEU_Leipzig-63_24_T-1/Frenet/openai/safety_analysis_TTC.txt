### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3 secs: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3253.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Real distance longitudinal is 2.88 m, and lateral is 5.58 m. Given that the obstacle is driving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally, there is a significant risk due to close proximity.
  - Distance safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity is longitudinal -0.03 m/s. TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity = 2.88 m / 0.03 m/s = 96 s. Although this indicates time, the proximity suggests an immediate risk situation.
  - Time safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **1** (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3254.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Real distance longitudinal is 9.04 m and lateral is 44.89 m, with the obstacle moving away longitudinally.
  - Distance safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity is 0.79 m/s longitudinally. Since the obstacle is moving away, the risk of collision is further diminished.
  - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **5** (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3255.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Real distance longitudinal is 4.02 m, and lateral is 23.78 m, with no lateral motion but driving toward the ego car longitudinally.
  - Distance safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity is -0.03 m/s. TTC = 4.02 m / 0.03 m/s = 134 s. The closeness implies immediate collision risk.
  - Time safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **1** (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3256.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Real distance longitudinal is 15.23 m and lateral is 8.51 m, moving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally and laterally.
  - Distance safety score: **2** (High Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity is longitudinal -0.43 m/s. TTC = 15.23 m / 0.43 m/s ≈ 35.4 s. The approaching nature of the obstacle heightens the urgency.
  - Time safety score: **2** (High Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **2** (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3257.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Real distance longitudinal is 28.14 m and lateral is 5.81 m, approaching longitudinally but moving away laterally.
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The longitudinal motion with a relative velocity of -4.37 m/s gives TTC = 28.14 m / 4.37 m/s ≈ 6.43 s. Presently at a safe distance.
  - Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **4** (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3261.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Real distance is 0.0 m both longitudinally and laterally, indicating an exact overlap. Immediate collision is highly probable.
  - Distance safety score: **0** (Collision)
  - Time Risk reason: With the relative velocity longitudinally at 4.53 m/s, a collision is imminent given the zero distance.
  - Time safety score: **0** (Collision)
  - Overall Risk score: **0** (Collision)

- **Obstacle ID: 3262.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Real distance longitudinal is 5.66 m and lateral is 46.82 m; the vehicle is moving toward the ego vehicle in both directions.
  - Distance safety score: **3** (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The obstacle has a relative velocity longitudinal of -0.61 m/s and TTC = 5.66 m / 0.61 m/s ≈ 9.27 s. There’s still a manageable risk.
  - Time safety score: **3** (Medium Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **3** (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3263.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Real distance longitudinal is 3.61 m and lateral is -12.57 m, with the obstacle moving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally.
  - Distance safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity longitudinal is -0.03 m/s. TTC = 3.61 m / 0.03 m/s = 120.33 s. Very close proximity suggests heightened immediate risk.
  - Time safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **1** (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3264.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Real distance longitudinal is 113.94 m and lateral is 0.48 m; the obstacle is moving toward but far enough to infringe risks.
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity is -9.25 m/s longitudinally, but TTC = 113.94 / 9.25 ≈ 12.3 s shows negligible chances of collision.
  - Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **4** (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3265.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Real distance longitudinal is 0.0 m laterally but far longitudinally. Its proximity suggests immediate caution.
  - Distance safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The coinciding longitudinal alignment shows collision is unavoidable.
  - Time safety score: **0** (Collision)
  - Overall Risk score: **0** (Collision)
