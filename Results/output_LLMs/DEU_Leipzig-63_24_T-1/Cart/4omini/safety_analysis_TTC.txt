Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 3253.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: The ego vehicle is relatively close to this obstacle, with a distance measured at approximately 12.1 meters away laterally.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Considering that the ego vehicle has a very low speed (0.027 m/s) and the obstacle is stationary, the Time to Collision (TTC) is significantly high when considering direct paths.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 3254.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle is significantly farther (estimated 39.5 meters) and traveling towards a different lanelet, minimizing immediate threats.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason**: With high velocity (11.7179 m/s) and deviation from the ego vehicle's trajectory, the TTC is also safely high.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 3255.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: The object is situated laterally at a distance of approximately 19.5 meters from the ego vehicle, but its stationary state contributes to low risk.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Potential collision time is negligible, as this object is not moving.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 3256.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Roughly 25 meters away laterally, presenting minimal risk.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Similar to previous obstacles, as the obstacle has a small velocity, contributing to low TTC.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 3257.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Approximately 31 meters away, with a lateral movement that will keep it distant from the ego vehicle trajectory.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Despite its speed, the likely collision course is not threatening due to the current positions.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID: 3261.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: 4.6 meters close in the lateral direction could pose a risk if pathing conflicts arise.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason**: The vehicle has a speed of 4.6262 m/s and is relatively close, giving a feasible TTC that can be calculated further.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

7. **Obstacle ID: 3262.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle is about 34.5 meters distant and in a different lanelet, which lessens potential impact risks.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason**: As the velocity is comparatively high, but the angle is not aligning directly with the ego vehicle, you have a high TTC.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

8. **Obstacle ID: 3263.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: 6.0 meters laterally could be seen as an encroachment but is still manageable.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason**: The stationary nature creates no urgency with TTC significantly higher.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

9. **Obstacle ID: 3264.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Located 74.3 meters away, presenting negligible collision risk with current trajectories.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Velocity is high, but distance keeps effective collision time vast.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

10. **Obstacle ID: 3265.0**
    - **Distance Risk Reason**: Approximately 45.3 meters away, safely within a different lanelet.
    - **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - **Time Risk Reason**: High speed with safe separation leads to no imminent collision.
    - **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
