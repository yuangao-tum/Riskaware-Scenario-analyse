Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 3253.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is located at a distance without any significant velocity and with no acceleration, thus the risk is negligible.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: With zero velocity, the obstacle does not approach the ego vehicle, resulting in no immediate time risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3254.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The moving obstacle is located at a significant lateral distance, but given it is traveling at high velocity, continued monitoring is necessary.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Although moving at a high speed, it is currently on a trajectory away from the ego car. However, future lane changes could alter risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 3.5

#### Obstacle ID: 3255.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The stationary obstacle is at a moderate distance, but poses no immediate risk with its stationary status.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: As the obstacle remains stationary, there is no time-based collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 4.5

#### Obstacle ID: 3256.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is relatively close; however, its low velocity suggests a low distance risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Since the velocity is low, the time-based risk is minimal, assuming no change in trajectory.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 4.5

#### Obstacle ID: 3257.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Though closer than many obstacles, its current trajectory suggests it will pass safely, albeit closely.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: The deceleration indicates it is likely to slow further, reducing risk over time.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 3.5

#### Obstacle ID: 3261.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle has a noteworthy distance with significant velocity increase, requiring monitoring but not immediate concern.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Positive acceleration indicates it could close distance, yet its current path shows minimal time-based risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 3262.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located at a large distance and decelerating, the risk remains moderate, controllable by maintaining trajectory awareness.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: The current deceleration lowers time-based risk as it indicates a slowing pace away from the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 3263.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Close to the ego vehicle but fully stationary, thereby posing minimal distance risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: No velocity leads to no time-based collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 4.5

#### Obstacle ID: 3264.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: At a significant distance and speed, though moving away, its trajectory doesn't suggest immediate threat.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Given the distance and trajectory direction, the time to collision is vastly above any threat level.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3265.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Approaching rapidly but maintains a safe trajectory from the ego vehicle, moderate distance risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: The increase in speed with its path starts demanding vigilant monitoring.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3
