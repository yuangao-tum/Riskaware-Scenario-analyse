Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories and dimensions of vehicles are not provided, I'm making simplified assumptions for demonstration:

1. **Point-mass approximation:** Vehicles are treated as point masses located at their center positions.
2. **Constant velocity and acceleration:**  For TTC calculations, I assume constant velocity and acceleration for the short time horizon we are interested in. This is reasonable for a near-term risk assessment.
3. **Lanelet information:** The lanelet information helps understand the general traffic flow and relative positioning of the ego vehicle and obstacles, but without precise lane geometry, I am approximating relative direction.
4. **TTC and MDC Thresholds:** The exact TTC and MDC values corresponding to each risk level depend on the specific application and safety requirements. I'll use some reasonable illustrative thresholds here, but these need to be calibrated based on the specific system.

**Illustrative Thresholds (Example, adjust as needed):**

* **TTClong**: < 2s: Extreme Risk (1), 2s - 4s: High Risk (2), 4s - 6s: Medium Risk (3), > 6s: Low Risk (4)
* **TTClat**: < 1s: Extreme Risk (1), 1s - 3s: High Risk (2), 3s - 5s: Medium Risk (3), > 5s: Low Risk (4)
* **MDClong**: < 5m: Extreme Risk (1), 5m - 10m: High Risk (2), 10m - 20m: Medium Risk (3), > 20m: Low Risk (4)
* **MDClat**: < 2m: Extreme Risk (1), 2m - 4m: High Risk (2), 4m - 6m: Medium Risk (3), > 6m: Low Risk (4)


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3253.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is in a different lanelet and about 10 meters away laterally.  MDClat indicates moderate risk. 
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary. Relative longitudinal motion is minimal, lateral motion also poses little risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3254.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is in a different lanelet and relatively far (around 30-40 meters away).  
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Obstacle is moving faster than ego vehicle, but in a different lanelet, reducing risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3255.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Similar to 3254, it is in a different lanelet and ~20-30m away.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary, posing minimal risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3256.0**

- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving slowly. Relatively low risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3257.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and about 30 meters away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving, but the lateral separation reduces risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3261.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and only about 1 meter away laterally, very close.  High Risk
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving, the lateral proximity represents a high risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2


- **Obstacle ID: 3262.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and over 30 meters away.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving but poses minimal risk due to the lateral separation.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 3263.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and ~ 5 meters away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary and therefore represents low risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3264.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far away (over 70 meters) and in a different lane.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Obstacle is moving but poses no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 3265.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and approximately 7 meters away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving, but lateral separation reduces the risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3
