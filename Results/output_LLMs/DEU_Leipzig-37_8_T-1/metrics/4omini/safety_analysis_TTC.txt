Safety analysis for timestep 3.1 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.1 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3070
  - Relative Direction: Front-right
  - Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal Distance (47.32) and Lateral Distance (27.29) are significantly safe as the DTC metrics indicate no collision risk; therefore, scores would be in the negligible range.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: DSC = 5 * 1 + 5 * (1-1) = 5
  - Time Risk Reason: Both Longitudinal Time (Infinity) and Lateral Time (Infinity) indicate there is no risk as the obstacles are moving away infinitely.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: TSC = 5 * 1 + 5 * (1-1) = 5
  - Overall Risk Score: 0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 5 = 5, rounded to 5.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3071
  - Relative Direction: Rear-left
  - Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal Distance (9.14) and Lateral Distance (1.96) indicate significant separation, scoring high safety levels but not negligible enough.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 2
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: DSC = 4 * 0 + 2 * (1-0) = 2
  - Time Risk Reason: Both Longitudinal Time (Infinity) and Lateral Time (Infinity) indicate safe distances, hence very low collision risk.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: TSC = 5 * 0 + 5 * (1-0) = 5
  - Overall Risk Score: 0.5 * 2 + 0.5 * 5 = 3.5, rounded to 4.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3072
  - Relative Direction: Front-right
  - Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal Distance (25.36) and Lateral Distance (9.8) suggest that the distances are sufficient to avoid collisions.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: DSC = 5 * 1 + 4 * (1-1) = 5
  - Time Risk Reason: Both Longitudinal Time (Infinity) and Lateral Time (Infinity) indicate no immediate threat of collision.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: TSC = 5 * 1 + 5 * (1-1) = 5
  - Overall Risk Score: 0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 5 = 5, rounded to 5.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3074
  - Relative Direction: Collision
  - Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal Distance (0.0) and Lateral Distance (0.0) indicates direct conflict as both scores indicate collision.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: DSC = 0 * 1 + 0 * (1-1) = 0
  - Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal Time (0.0) and Lateral Time (0.0) also indicate immediate collision, reflecting the danger of the situation.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Time Safety Score: TSC = 0 * 1 + 0 * (1-1) = 0
  - Overall Risk Score: 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 0 = 0, rounded to 0.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3075
  - Relative Direction: Front-left
  - Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal Distance (5.47) and Lateral Distance (2.72) suggest that while there is a proximity concern, it is not immediately dangerous as the values score on the lower end.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 2  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: DSC = 2 * 1 + 3 * (1-1) = 2
  - Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal Time (0.86) and Lateral Time (1.19) suggest a potential threat; however, they are manageable in terms of safety.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 2
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 3
  - Overall Time Safety Score: TSC = 2 * 1 + 3 * (1-1) = 2
  - Overall Risk Score: 0.5 * 2 + 0.5 * 2 = 2.
