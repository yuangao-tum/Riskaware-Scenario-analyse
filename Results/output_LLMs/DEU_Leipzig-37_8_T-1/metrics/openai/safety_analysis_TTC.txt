Safety analysis for timestep 3.1 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.1 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3070
- Relative Direction: Front-right
- Distance Risk Reason: The DTC values indicate a safe distance, with Longitudinal DTC being 47.32 and Lateral DTC being 27.29, suggesting no immediate risk. 
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5 
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
- Time Risk Reason: As both TTC values are infinity due to the obstacle moving away, there is negligible risk of collision. 
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Risk Score: 5
