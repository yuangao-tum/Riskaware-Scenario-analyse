Safety analysis for timestep 3.1 seconds:
``` 
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.1 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3070
  - Distance Risk Reason: Both longitudinal (47.32) and lateral (27.29) distances are significantly high, indicating negligible risk for a front-right obstacle.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
  - Time Risk Reason: Both longitudinal and lateral times to collision are infinity, indicating no risk for a front-right obstacle.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
  - Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3071
  - Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance (9.14) is low but lateral distance (1.96) is of medium risk, this is a rear left obstacle but still manageable as overall risk decreases with longer longitudinal scores.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.0
  - Time Risk Reason: Both longitudinal and lateral times to collision are infinity, indicating zero risk for a rear-left obstacle.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
  - Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3072
  - Distance Risk Reason: Safe longitudinal distance (25.36) and adequate lateral distance (9.8) for a front-right moving away obstacle.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
  - Time Risk Reason: Both longitudinal and lateral times to collision are infinity, representing no collision risk.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
  - Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3074
  - Distance Risk Reason: Immediate collision presence with no longitudinal (0.0) or lateral (0.0) distances detected.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0
  - Time Risk Reason: Immediate collision scenario as both longitudinal and lateral times to collision indicate zero (0.0).
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0
  - Overall Risk Score: 0

- Obstacle ID: 3075
  - Distance Risk Reason: Moderate-longitudinal distance (5.47) coupled with short lateral distance (2.72), indicating high risk for a front-left obstacle as it moves toward the ego car.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.5
  - Time Risk Reason: High risk as longitudinal (0.86) and lateral (1.19) times to collision indicate close proximity of threat.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 2
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 3
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 2.5
  - Overall Risk Score: 3
