### Safety analysis for timestep 3.1: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 3070.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is 47.32 m longitudinally and -27.29 m laterally from the ego vehicle. While the lateral distance is significant, the longitudinal distance provides a buffer against collision.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocity indicates that the obstacle is moving away, giving enough time before any potential collision risk arises.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 3071.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The distance is -9.14 m longitudinally and 1.96 m laterally, which indicates that the obstacle is very close to the ego vehicle and in the path of travel.
  - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocity shows that this obstacle is moving away, but its close proximity indicates an immediate hazard.
  - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 3072.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** With a longitudinal distance of 25.36 m and a lateral distance of -9.8 m, the obstacle is relatively far. However, its proximity in the lateral direction still poses a risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Being that the obstacle is moving away, it offers the ego vehicle sufficient time to react.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 3074.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Exact longitudinal and lateral alignment (0.0 m both) indicates immediate collision potential.
  - **Distance safety score:** 0 (Collision)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The presence of 3.52 m/s longitudinally indicates motion but with no distance separation, immediate action is required.
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 0 (Collision)

- **Obstacle ID:** 3075.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance of 5.47 m and lateral distance of 2.72 m indicates proximity which can lead to a potential collision.
  - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocities demonstrate danger, as the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
  - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)
