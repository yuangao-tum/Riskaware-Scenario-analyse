### Safety analysis for timestep 3.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3070**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located 47.32m longitudinally and -27.29m laterally (front-right) and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3071**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located -9.14m longitudinally and 1.96m laterally (rear-left) and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3072**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located 25.36m longitudinally and -9.8m laterally (front-right) and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3074**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at 0.0m longitudinally and 0.0m laterally implying a collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle has a longitudinal relative velocity of 3.52 m/s and almost zero lateral relative velocity, indicating an immediate collision.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 3075**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle located at 5.47m longitudinally and 2.72m laterally (front-left) and moving towards the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  The relative velocity and distance suggest a high risk of collision.  TTClong = 5.47m / 6.32m/s = 0.86s. TTClat = 2.72m / 2.3m/s = 1.18s. These values indicate an imminent collision risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1
