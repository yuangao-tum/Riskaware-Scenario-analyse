### Safety analysis for timestep 3.1 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 3070.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: With a longitudinal distance of 47.32 m and moving away both longitudinally and laterally, the risk is minimal.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Given the relative velocities and large distance, the time to collision in both directions suggests no imminent threat.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 3071.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in the rear-left with a considerable negative longitudinal distance (-9.14 m), moving away in both axes.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: As the obstacle moves further back, there is no impending collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 3072.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: At 25.36 m ahead and moving away laterally, the obstacle poses a low threat.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: With obstacle moving away longitudinally and laterally, time to collision remains a manageable factor.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 3074.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: It is exactly at the ego car's position (0.0 m longitudinal and lateral distances), which indicates a collision.
- **Distance safety score**: 0 (Collision Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Time to collision is effectively zero as the obstacle is colliding with the ego car.
- **Time safety score**: 0 (Collision Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 0 (Collision Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 3075.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: At 5.47 m ahead and moving towards the ego vehicle, both longitudinally and laterally.
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Given the negative velocities suggesting convergence, time to collision is short, implying significant risk.
- **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3074.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

In this scenario, Obstacle 3074.0 is in direct collision with the ego vehicle, warranting the most urgent attention and action to mitigate impact. The other obstacles listed carry varying degrees of risk but not to the levels indicated by Collision or Extreme Risk.
