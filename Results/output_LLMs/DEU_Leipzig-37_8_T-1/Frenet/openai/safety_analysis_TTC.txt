### Safety analysis for timestep 3.1: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3070.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 47.32 meters longitudinally and -27.29 meters laterally away from the ego car. This indicates that it's relatively far and moving away from the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity is 7.84 m/s longitudinally and -6.39 m/s laterally, suggesting that the ego vehicle is not on a collision course and the TTC can be calculated as:
      - Longitudinal TTC = Distance Longitudinal / Relative Velocity Longitudinal = 47.32 m / 7.84 m/s ≈ 6.03 s 
      - Lateral TTC = Distance Lateral / Relative Velocity Lateral = -27.29 m / -6.39 m/s ≈ 4.27 s 
      - Significant time remains to react, indicating safety.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3071.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is -9.14 meters longitudinally (indicating it's behind the ego vehicle) and 1.96 meters laterally. This positions it close and indicates a minor threat but it's moving away.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocities here are -11.65 m/s longitudinally (moving away) and approximately 0.06 m/s laterally. This gives:
      - Longitudinal TTC = -(-9.14 m) / -(-11.65 m/s) ≈ 0.78 s 
      - Lateral TTC = 1.96 m / 0.06 m/s ≈ 32.67 s 
      - The longitudinal TTC indicates a potential close call but it’s moving away, giving a manageable time.
  - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3072.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 25.36 meters longitudinally and -9.8 meters laterally away, thus indicating a considerable distance and also moving away.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity is 5.97 m/s longitudinally and -4.88 m/s laterally. Thus:
      - Longitudinal TTC = 25.36 m / 5.97 m/s ≈ 4.25 s 
      - Lateral TTC = -9.8 m / -4.88 m/s ≈ 2.01 s 
      - While lateral time is a bit tighter, the overall risk remains manageable.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3074.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is exactly at 0.0 m in both longitudinal and lateral dimensions, implying an impactful situation.
  - Distance safety score: 0 (Collision risk)
  - Time Risk reason: With a direct overlap in position (TTC calculations are essentially instant with relative velocity), this scenario confirms immediate collision.
  - Time safety score: 0 (Collision risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 0 (Immediate Collision)

- **Obstacle ID: 3075.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 5.47 meters longitudinally and 2.72 meters laterally, indicating a close proximity. The movement towards the ego vehicle presents a potential risk.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The negative longitudinal velocity of -6.32 m/s indicates that this vehicle is approaching quickly. Thus:
      - Longitudinal TTC = 5.47 m / 6.32 m/s ≈ 0.87 s 
      - Lateral TTC = 2.72 m / 2.3 m/s ≈ 1.18 s 
      - Close time to collision warrants concern given that it’s approaching rapidly.
  - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 2
