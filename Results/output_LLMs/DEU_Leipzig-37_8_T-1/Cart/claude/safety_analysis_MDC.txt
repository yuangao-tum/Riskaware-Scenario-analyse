Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.1 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario focusing on obstacles in proximity to the ego vehicle (ID: 3073.0).

Key observations:
1. The ego vehicle is in lanelet 393.0
2. Obstacle 3074.0 is in the same lanelet
3. Other vehicles are in different lanelets but should be monitored for potential conflicts

Safety Analysis:

1. For Obstacle 3074.0:
- Distance Risk reason: Consistently following behind ego vehicle in same lanelet with decreasing speed, maintaining safe following distance (>5m)
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity is decreasing, with controlled deceleration
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

2. For Obstacle 3070.0:
- Distance Risk reason: In different lanelet (186.0), maintaining parallel course
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: No immediate collision path
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. For Obstacle 3071.0:
- Distance Risk reason: Moving in adjacent lanelet, but trajectories don't intersect
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: No immediate collision path
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

4. For remaining obstacles:
All maintain safe distances and are in different lanelets with no immediate collision risks.

Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

The analysis shows no vehicles with collision (score 0) or extreme risk (score 1). The main point of interest is Obstacle 3074.0, which is following the ego vehicle but maintaining safe distance and showing controlled deceleration, indicating proper following behavior. The ego vehicle is also decelerating gradually, which helps maintain safe conditions.
