Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.1 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.1: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
#### Obstacle ID: 3070
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle 3070 is located in a different lanelet (186.0) than the ego vehicle (393.0). The positioning and lanelet separation suggest minimal interference in the trajectory and no immediate proximity in the longitudinal or lateral directions.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Given the obstacle's position in a separate lane, the TTC values (longitudinal and lateral) will be high, suggesting no immediate threat of collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3071
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 3071 is in a nearby lanelet (392.0) but is positioned further away with no direct overlap with the ego vehicle. Relative positioning indicates a safe distance both longitudinally and laterally.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Due to the obstacle's orientation and speed, the TTC values might be moderate but manageable, allowing for timely evasive actions if necessary.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 3072
- **Distance Risk reason**: Like obstacle 3070, obstacle 3072 is also in lanelet 186.0. The spatial and lane sidelines imply no immediate conflict with the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The TTC values are expected to be high due to separate lanes and adequate separation from the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3074
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 3074 is in the same lanelet (393.0) as the ego vehicle and relatively close by in both orientation and positioning, which may influence the longitudinal trajectory slightly.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Moderate TTC values are anticipated as they're moving slowly and the ego vehicle maintains a low speed, allowing for timely reactions. However, their proximity may slightly increase perceived risk.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 3075
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in a different lanelet (2060.0) with separation from the ego vehicle's path, minimal collision risk is identified.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Given the relative gap and distinct lane, the TTC values present low collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5
