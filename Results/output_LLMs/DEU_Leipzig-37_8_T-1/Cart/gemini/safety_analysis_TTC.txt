Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.1 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

*  Since precise trajectories are not given, I'm assuming straight-line motion for a short duration for TTC calculations.  A more robust analysis would require trajectory predictions.
* I'm inferring "relative direction" based on position and orientation differences. More precise velocity vectors would improve accuracy.
* I'm using Euclidean distance for MDC.
* I am unable to provide numeric TTC and MDC values without more information, like relative velocities in longitudinal and lateral directions. Therefore, I'll give qualitative assessments based on the descriptions.

### Obstacle Analysis:

* **Obstacle ID: 3070**
    - Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle is in a different lanelet (186) than the ego vehicle (393), suggesting some lateral separation. However, the positions indicate proximity.  More information is needed to determine the actual separation.
    - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's higher velocity (10.2497) compared to the ego vehicle (0.1741) raises concern. The relative direction needs to be determined to assess if they are converging.
    - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

* **Obstacle ID: 3071**
    - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a neighboring lanelet (392). The positions suggest close proximity. The different orientations (-2.3373 vs 0.8091) could indicate a risky situation if the obstacle is turning towards the ego vehicle.
    - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: The obstacle's high velocity (11.4729) and significant acceleration (1.3084) represent a significant risk given the proximity.
    - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

* **Obstacle ID: 3072**
    - Distance Risk reason: Similar to obstacle 3070, this obstacle is in lanelet 186 while the ego vehicle is in 393.  Their positions suggest proximity, but we need more information to assess the true lateral separation.
    - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's velocity (7.843) is higher than the ego vehicle's.  The relative direction is crucial to understand if a collision course exists.
    - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

* **Obstacle ID: 3074**
    - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet (393) as the ego vehicle and their positions are very close. This poses a high risk.
    - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity (3.69) while greater than the ego vehicle's is not excessively high. The similar orientations suggest they are largely moving in the same direction, reducing the immediate risk slightly.
    - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

* **Obstacle ID: 3075**
    - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (2060). Further information is required to clarify the layout and proximity to the ego vehicle's lanelet.  Its position suggests some proximity but without lane geometry, we can't be certain.
    - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity (6.5643) is significantly higher than the ego vehicleâ€™s, but the different lanelet suggests it might not be directly on a collision course.
    - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)
