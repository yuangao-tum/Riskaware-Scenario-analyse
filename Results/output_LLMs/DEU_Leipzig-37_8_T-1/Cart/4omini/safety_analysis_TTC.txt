Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.1 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.1 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 3070.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving at a relatively high speed (10.2497 m/s) and is located in a different lanelet (186.0). The distance calculation shows that it is not in immediate interaction path as it is laterally offset.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk), as it is likely to not interfere with the Ego's lanelet in the near future.
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC calculation demonstrates there is enough time before any potential interaction occurs, with at least **6 seconds** available before any intersection occurs.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk), with ample response time.
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3071.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is on another lanelet (392.0), and with a relative position, it poses no immediate risk to the Ego vehicle. The distance is significant, implying no immediate risk of interaction.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: With both vehicles moving in different directions and the calculated TTC showing a significant safe interval, thereâ€™s no concern for an imminent collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3072.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 186.0, the distance is sufficient to avoid collision due to the substantial lateral distance from the Ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC is also favorable due to relative velocities, suggesting no immediate threats.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3074.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is also in lanelet 393.0, which is the same lanelet as the Ego, but the separation distance mitigates the threat of collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC indicates that while the obstacle is moving towards the Ego vehicle at a slower rate, the current metrics show a safe interval of over **5 seconds** before any potential interaction.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3075.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is located in lanelet 2060.0, which is a different lanelet than the Ego vehicle. The distance is considerable, providing sufficient buffer against a potential collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: With the obstacle moving at a speed faster than the Ego, the TTC indicates no imminent threat, as the distance allows for sufficient response time.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
``` 

### Conclusion:
All evaluated obstacles exhibit a Low Risk status with no immediate threats leading towards collision. Given their respective distances and velocities, the scenario shows favorable conditions for the Ego vehicle with ample time to react, making it safe from any imminent impacts.
