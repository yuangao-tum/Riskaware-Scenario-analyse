Safety analysis for timestep 2.9 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.9: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30231
- Relative Direction: Rear-right
- Distance Risk Reason: "Longitudinal distance to collision is 11.45, which indicates a negligible risk. Lateral distance to collision is 1.51, which indicates a medium risk due to the proximity."
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.5 (rounded to 4)
- Time Risk Reason: "Longitudinal time to collision is 4.62, indicating a low risk. Lateral time to collision is 1.5, which signifies a medium risk due to the imminent approach."
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 3
- Overall Time Safety Score: 3.5 (rounded to 4)
- Overall Risk Score: 4 (rounded to the nearest integer)

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30232
- Relative Direction: Front-left
