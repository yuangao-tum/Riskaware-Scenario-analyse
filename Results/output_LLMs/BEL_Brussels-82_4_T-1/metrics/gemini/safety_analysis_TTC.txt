Safety analysis for timestep 2.9 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30231
- Relative Direction: Rear-right
- Distance Risk Reason:  Longitudinal distance is > 5 (negligible risk), Lateral distance is between 1 and 3 (medium risk). Since the dominant direction is lateral (Rear-right), the lateral distance is the primary concern.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.0
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal time is > 3 and < 5 (low risk), and Lateral time is between 1 and 3 (medium risk). Since the dominant direction is lateral (Rear-right), the lateral time is the primary concern.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 3
- Overall Time Safety Score: 3.0
- Overall Risk Score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30232
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: Both longitudinal and lateral distances are > 5 (negligible risk).
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
- Time Risk Reason: Both longitudinal and lateral times are > 5 (negligible risk).
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30233
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance is <= 0.5 (extreme risk), and Lateral distance is 0 (collision risk). Since the dominant direction is longitudinal (Behind), the longitudinal distance is the primary concern.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal time is <= 0.5 (extreme risk), and Lateral time is 0 (collision risk). Since the dominant direction is longitudinal (Behind), the longitudinal time is the primary concern.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
- Overall Risk Score: 1
