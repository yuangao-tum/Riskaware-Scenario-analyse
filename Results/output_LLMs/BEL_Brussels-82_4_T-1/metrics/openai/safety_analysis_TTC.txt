Safety analysis for timestep 2.9 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30231
- Relative Direction: Rear-right
- Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is close laterally (1.51), but far longitudinally (11.45), indicating a low immediate risk of collision.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4 
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.5 → rounded to 4
- Time Risk Reason: The obstacle has a manageable longitudinal time to collision (4.62) but a shorter lateral time (1.5) indicating moderate risk.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 3
- Overall Time Safety Score: 3.5 → rounded to 4
- Overall Risk Score: (0.5 * 4 + 0.5 * 4) = 4

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30232
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: This obstacle is longitudinally far (79.24) and laterally further (14.7), indicating negligible risk.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
- Time Risk Reason: Both time metrics indicate significant separation with very high values, hence minimal risk.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Risk Score: (0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 5) = 5

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30233
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is extremely close both longitudinally (0.14) and exactly aligned laterally (0.0), indicating a collision risk.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 0
- Time Risk Reason: The time to collision is critically low (0.04), meaning immediate action is needed as a collision is imminent.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Risk Score: (0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 0) = 0
