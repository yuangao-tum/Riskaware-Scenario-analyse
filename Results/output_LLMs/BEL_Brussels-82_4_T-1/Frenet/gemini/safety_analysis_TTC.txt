### Safety analysis for timestep 2.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30231.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is relatively close to the ego vehicle, being slightly behind and to the right (-11.45m longitudinal, -1.51m lateral).  While behind, the lateral distance is small, suggesting a potential lane change conflict.
- **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:**  The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally (2.48 m/s) and laterally (1.01 m/s). While the longitudinal velocity suggests it's catching up, the lateral velocity indicates a potential cut-in maneuver. With longitudinal acceleration of 1.0 m/s² and lateral acceleration of -0.6 m/s², the risk is increased.
- **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30232.0
- **Distance Risk reason:**  The obstacle is far ahead and to the left (79.24m longitudinal, 14.7m lateral) posing no immediate threat.
- **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocity (-10.04 m/s longitudinal, -0.18 m/s lateral) suggests the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, and the lateral movement is minimal. The relative accelerations (-1.34 m/s² longitudinal and 1.2 m/s² lateral) do not pose an immediate concern given the large distance.
- **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30233.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is extremely close behind the ego vehicle (-0.14m longitudinal, 0.0m lateral), indicating a very high risk of collision.
- **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:**  The obstacle is closing in longitudinally at 3.46 m/s. Lateral velocity is 1.22 m/s, increasing risk due to possible misalignment. Longitudinal acceleration at 1.2 m/s² worsens the situation, while lateral acceleration at -0.72 m/s² suggests a slight move away laterally but not sufficient to mitigate risk given close proximity.
- **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
