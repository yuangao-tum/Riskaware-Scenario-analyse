### Safety analysis for timestep 2.9 seconds:
Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30231.0
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is located at a longitudinal distance of -11.45 m and lateral distance of -1.51 m indicating it is behind and to the right of the ego car. A negative longitudinal distance indicates it is moving closer to the ego vehicle, which increases the collision risk.
  - Distance safety score: **2** (High Risk) - Due to its nearness and the motion toward the ego vehicle and close proximity, there is a high chance of collision if actions are not taken quickly.
  
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity components indicate that the obstacle is closing in at 2.48 m/s longitudinally and 1.01 m/s laterally. The TTC can be calculated as follows:
    - TTC_long = |DTClong| / |Vrel_long| = 11.45 / 2.48 ≈ 4.61 seconds.
    - TTC_lat = |DTClat| / |Vrel_lat| = 1.51 / 1.01 ≈ 1.49 seconds.
    Given the shorter TTC_lat and its motion towards the ego vehicle, the overall risk is higher.
  - Time safety score: **2** (High Risk) - Need prompt attention as the lateral component indicates a substantial risk of being struck if no evasive actions are taken.
  
  - Overall Risk score: **2** (High Risk)

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30232.0
  - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is longitudinally far away at 79.24 m, indicating low immediate threat; however, it is approaching from the front-left at a lateral distance of 14.7 m, which could become a concern if not addressed.
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk) - Although close in the lateral direction, the long distance in longitudinal terms offers a lower collision risk in the short term.
  
  - Time Risk reason: The relative velocities indicate a closing speed of -10.04 m/s longitudinally, which suggests the obstacle is getting closer. Calculating:
    - TTC_long = |DTClong| / |Vrel_long| = 79.24 / 10.04 ≈ 7.88 seconds.
    - TTC_lat = |DTClat| / |Vrel_lat| = 14.7 / 0.18 ≈ 81.67 seconds.
    The long TTC in the longitudinal direction reflects a more manageable scenario in terms of collision risk over time.
  - Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk) - Given the long TTC values, this obstacle does not present an immediate risk.

  - Overall Risk score: **4** (Low Risk)

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30233.0
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is located at a longitudinal distance of -0.14 m, meaning it is directly behind the ego vehicle and very close to it. The minimal lateral distance reinforces the danger due to the proximity.
  - Distance safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk) - Given the near-zero longitudinal distance and direct alignment with the ego vehicle, this represents a scenario of extreme collision risk.

  - Time Risk reason: The obstacle has a relative velocity of 3.46 m/s longitudinally, indicating it is moving closer. Therefore, calculating:
    - TTC_long = |DTClong| / |Vrel_long| = 0.14 / 3.46 ≈ 0.04 seconds.
    - TTC_lat = |DTClat| / |Vrel_lat| = 0.0 / 1.22 = ∞ (no lateral risk follows).
    The very low TTC suggests immediate emergency measures are clearly required.
  - Time safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk) - The immediate closure to the ego vehicle indicates a near-certain collision without urgent avoidance actions.

  - Overall Risk score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
