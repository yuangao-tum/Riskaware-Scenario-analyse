### Safety analysis for timestep 2.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30231.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: 
  - **DTClong**: -11.45 m (Obstacle is close behind the ego vehicle in the rear-right quadrant)
  - **DTClat**: -1.51 m (Lateral proximity is relatively close)
  - The negative distance indicates the obstacle is behind, which could quickly lead to a collision if not addressed.
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**:
  - **TTClong**: Given the relative longitudinal velocity of 2.48 m/s and a distance of 11.45 m, TTC can be roughly estimated as 11.45 / 2.48 ≈ 4.6 seconds. The lateral movement of 1.01 m/s slightly reduces the overall collision risk over time.
  - This implies a potentially manageable but cautious scenario, especially with the relative acceleration indicating the obstacle is slightly gaining speed.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30232.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: 
  - **DTClong**: 79.24 m (Obstacle is far in front of the ego vehicle in the front-left quadrant)
  - **DTClat**: 14.7 m (Obstacle is significantly to the left)
  - Sufficient distance longitudinally minimizes immediate collision risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: 
  - **TTClong**: The relative velocity of -10.04 m/s (closing in) with a large initial distance indicates a more extended time until any potential collision, approximately 79.24 / 10.04 ≈ 7.9 seconds.
  - Lateral velocity is minimal and doesn't significantly impact the risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk) 

#### Obstacle ID: 30233.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: 
  - **DTClong**: -0.14 m (Obstacle is extremely close behind the ego vehicle)
  - **DTClat**: 0.0 m (Directly behind the ego vehicle without lateral separation)
  - Imminent collision risk due to zero lateral separation and minimal longitudinal gap.
- **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**:
  - **TTClong**: With a relative longitudinal velocity of 3.46 m/s and essentially zero longitudinal distance, the time to collision is very short, indicating a collision is imminent unless evasive action is taken.
  - Lateral velocity contributes marginally but overall increases the risk.
- **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
