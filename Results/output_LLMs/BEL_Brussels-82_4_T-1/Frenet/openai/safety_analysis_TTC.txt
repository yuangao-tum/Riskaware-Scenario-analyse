### Safety analysis for timestep 2.9: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### - Obstacle ID: 30231.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The ego vehicle has a longitudinal distance of -11.45 m to this obstacle, indicating it is very close from the rear-right. The lateral distance of -1.51 m means it is encroaching from the right side.
- **Distance safety score**: Based on the close longitudinal and lateral distances, the risk score is assessed as **2** (High Risk).
  
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity of the obstacle towards the ego vehicle is significant, with longitudinal velocity at 2.48 m/s and lateral velocity at 1.01 m/s. To find the Time to Collision (TTC):
  - Longitudinal TTC = DTClong / Vrel_long = 11.45 m / 2.48 m/s ≈ 4.61 s
  - Lateral TTC = DTClat / Vrel_lat = 1.51 m / 1.01 m/s ≈ 1.49 s
  - The minimum TTC is 1.49 seconds, indicating that a collision is likely if no actions are taken. This yields a risk assessment of **2** (High Risk).

- **Overall Risk score**: The overall risk is the average of both safety scores: (2 + 2) / 2 = **2** (High Risk).

#### - Obstacle ID: 30232.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is 79.24 m away longitudinally, which is not close, but lateral distance of 14.7 m indicates some proximity from the front-left direction.
- **Distance safety score**: This results in a score of **4** (Low Risk) as it is quite far.

- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is -10.04 m/s longitudinally towards the ego vehicle but is over 79 m away:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 79.24 m / 10.04 m/s ≈ 7.89 s
  - Lateral TTC = 14.7 m / 0.18 m/s ≈ 81.67 s
  - The minimum TTC of 7.89 seconds indicates a low likelihood of an impact, resulting in a score of **5** (Negligible Risk).

- **Overall Risk score**: The overall risk score is (4 + 5) / 2 = **4** (Low Risk).

#### - Obstacle ID: 30233.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle has a longitudinal distance of -0.14 m and lateral of 0.0 m, indicating it's nearly on top of the ego vehicle from behind.
- **Distance safety score**: This critical closeness generates a score of **1** (Extreme Risk).

- **Time Risk reason**: With a relative velocity of 3.46 m/s longitudinally and relatively static laterally:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 0.14 m / 3.46 m/s ≈ 0.04 s
  - Lateral TTC cannot be calculated (as DTClat is 0), indicating potential collision.
  - The TTC of 0.04 seconds indicates immediate danger, thus scoring **1** (Extreme Risk).

- **Overall Risk score**: The overall risk is (1 + 1) / 2 = **1** (Extreme Risk).

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30233.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30233.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

In the analysis, both obstacles 30231.0 and 30233.0 pose significant risks, with the latter requiring immediate attention, while the former requires prompt action. Obstacle 30232.0 represents a low risk and can be monitored for further developments.
