Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.9 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

**Obstacle ID: 30231.0**
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The position of the ego vehicle is at (-456.8809, 250.3498) and the obstacle at (-470.6345, 259.0195), leading to a calculated distance of approximately 18.17 units. The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle from a closer angle in their trajectory.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk).
- **Time Risk Reason**: The ego vehicle’s speed is 2.2395 m/s while the obstacle is at 4.8243 m/s towards the ego’s lateral path. The relative velocity calculated yields a Time to Collision (TTC) of 2.10 seconds. This indicates a moderate risk as there's time to react but it requires attention.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk).
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk).

**Obstacle ID: 30232.0**
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The distance between the ego vehicle at (-456.8809, 250.3498) and the obstacle at (-384.7447, 204.7856) is approximately 82.53 units. The obstacle is moving significantly faster than the ego vehicle but is positioned comfortably away at this moment. 
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk).
- **Time Risk Reason**: With a relative speed translating to a TTC of approximately 12.54 seconds, this gives a clear buffer time for the ego vehicle to avoid any potential conflict.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk).
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk).

**Obstacle ID: 30233.0**
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Calculating the distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle ID 30233.0, the distance is approximately 10.2 units. The trajectory of the blockage is very close to that of the ego vehicle.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 2 (High Risk).
- **Time Risk Reason**: The TTC based on their speeds and positions shows there could be contact in about 1.88 seconds, which is critical and requires immediate reaction.
- **Time Safety Score**: 2 (High Risk).
- **Overall Risk Score**: 2 (High Risk).

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
``` 

### Overall Findings:
- The analysis shows that there are no immediate collision threats or extreme risks, but Obstacle IDs 30231.0 and 30233.0 have been identified as having medium and high risks respectively in terms of possible collision. Active monitoring and quick maneuvers would be essential to avoid any impact in these scenarios.
