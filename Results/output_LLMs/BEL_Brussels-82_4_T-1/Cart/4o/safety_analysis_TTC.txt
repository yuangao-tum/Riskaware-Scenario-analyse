Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.9 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.9: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Ego Vehicle Status:
- Position: (-456.8809, 250.3498)
- Orientation: -0.7556600973681579
- Velocity: 2.2395 m/s
- Lanelet: 1320.0

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30231.0
- Position: (-470.6345, 259.0195)
- Orientation: -0.5448
- Velocity: 4.8243 m/s
- Lanelet: 122.0

##### Distance Risk Reason:
- The Euclidean distance is relatively significant given the position difference between the ego vehicle and the obstacle. They are not in the same lanelet, contributing to negligible lateral collision risk.

##### Distance Safety Score: 5

##### Time Risk Reason:
- The higher velocity of the obstacle compared to the ego vehicle implies they are moving apart in terms of position over time. Thus the Time to Collision values (considering longitudinal and lateral) indicate no imminent collision risk.

##### Time Safety Score: 5

##### Overall Risk Score: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30232.0
- Position: (-384.7447, 204.7856)
- Orientation: 2.4088
- Velocity: 7.802 m/s
- Lanelet: 1325.0

##### Distance Risk Reason:
- The obstacle is in a different lanelet and positioned far on the right side of the ego vehicle's path. There is a significant physical distance indicating no overlap.

##### Distance Safety Score: 5

##### Time Risk Reason:
- The obstacle is moving with a higher speed away from the path involving the ego vehicle. Relative direction and speed ensure no time-based collision likelihood.

##### Time Safety Score: 5

##### Overall Risk Score: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30233.0
- Position: (-460.7417, 253.024)
- Orientation: -0.5448
- Velocity: 5.8264 m/s
- Lanelet: 122.0

##### Distance Risk Reason:
- The obstacle is not in the same lanelet, yet is closer than other assessed obstacles. However, physical proximity still suggests no immediate threat in the lateral context.

##### Distance Safety Score: 4

##### Time Risk Reason:
- Given its higher speed and same directional orientation, the Time to Collision in both lateral and longitudinal aspects effectively indicates manageability with current trajectory adjustments but must be monitored.

##### Time Safety Score: 4

##### Overall Risk Score: 4
