Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.9 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.9: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30231.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (122.0) than the ego vehicle (1320.0).  However, its position (-470.6345, 259.0195) is relatively close to the ego vehicle's position (-456.8809, 250.3498). Further analysis is required to determine the lateral distance and potential risk.  Without precise lanelet geometry, we assume moderate risk due to proximity and different lanelet occupancy. Additional information like lane widths and their relative orientations is crucial for accurate assessment.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's velocity (4.8243) is higher than the ego vehicle's (2.2395), and it has positive acceleration (1.1941).  This suggests the obstacle might be approaching the ego vehicle or its path, posing a time-dependent risk.  The lack of inter-vehicle angle information makes it difficult to precisely determine TTC.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30232.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (1325.0) and its position (-384.7447, 204.7856) suggests it is significantly further away from the ego vehicle than obstacle 30231.0. The difference in lanelet IDs also decreases collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: While this obstacle has the highest velocity (7.802) and acceleration (1.7652), its larger distance from the ego vehicle reduces the immediate time-related risk. Still, its high dynamic state requires monitoring.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 30233.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle, also in lanelet 122.0,  presents a similar situation to obstacle 30231.0.  Its position (-460.7417, 253.024) is close to the ego vehicle, and it's in a different lane. Further analysis, particularly lateral distance calculation based on lane geometry, is crucial. We assume a moderate risk due to proximity and different lanelet IDs.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity (5.8264) and acceleration (1.4331) indicate potential risk. The exact risk level is uncertain due to the lack of angle information and lane configurations.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
