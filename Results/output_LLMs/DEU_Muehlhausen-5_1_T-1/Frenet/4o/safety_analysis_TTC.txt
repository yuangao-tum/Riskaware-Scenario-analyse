### Safety analysis for timestep 1.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### **Obstacle Analysis:**

- **Obstacle ID: 31.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is in the front-left with longitudinal distance of 11.11 m and lateral distance of 21.67 m. The obstacle is moving toward the ego car longitudinally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal relative velocity is -2.5 m/s, implying a TTC of approximately 4.44 seconds. No lateral risk due to stationary lateral velocity.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 34.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is in the front-left with a longitudinal distance of 14.61 m and lateral distance of 0.17 m. The obstacle is moving toward the ego car longitudinally but moving away laterally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal relative velocity is -2.5 m/s, implying a TTC of approximately 5.84 seconds. Lateral risk is reducing due to lateral movement away.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 36.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is in the front-right with longitudinal distance of 14.61 m and lateral distance of -21.14 m. It is moving toward the ego car both longitudinally and laterally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal relative velocity is -2.5 m/s, implying a TTC of approximately 5.84 seconds. Minimal lateral threat due to minimal lateral velocity.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 312.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is in the front-left with a longitudinal distance of 11.12 m and lateral distance of 28.95 m. It is driving toward the ego car longitudinally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal relative velocity of -2.5 m/s gives a TTC of approximately 4.45 seconds. No lateral motion risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 330.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in exact collision with 0.0 m longitudinal and lateral distance.
  - **Distance safety score**: 0 (Collision)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Both longitudinal and lateral velocities suggest a position within collision proximity.
  - **Time safety score**: 0 (Collision)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 0 (Collision)

- **Obstacle ID: 341.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is behind with longitudinal distance of -11.99 m. It is moving towards the ego car from behind.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Positive relative velocity indicates moving away with or trailing the ego car. No collision risk imminent.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 361.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is front-left with a longitudinal distance of 14.63 m and lateral distance of 32.83 m. Moving toward longitudinally, laterally moving away.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal velocity of -2.53 m/s for a TTC of approximately 5.78 seconds. Chiefly moving laterally away.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 365.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is front-left with a longitudinal distance of 18.3 m and lateral distance of 6.55 m. It is longitudinally moving toward but laterally away.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal relative velocity of -5.3 m/s allows for a TTC of approximately 3.45 seconds. Minimal lateral risk due to lateral movement away.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 369.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is in the front with a longitudinal distance of 38.42 m, aligning longitudinally but poses no lateral threat.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal velocity of -5.83 m/s suggests good spacing and a TTC of approximately 6.59 seconds.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 371.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is directly in front with a long longitudinal distance of 50.51 m without lateral threat.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: A relative velocity of -5.47 m/s implies ample time (approximately 9.23 seconds) to react and avoid collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
