### Safety analysis for timestep 1.3: 

Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 31.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = 11.11 m and DTClat = 21.67 m indicate a reasonable distance from the ego car with the obstacle moving toward it longitudinally but at a distance.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC_long = DTClong / |Vrel_long| = 11.11 m / 2.5 m/s = 4.44 s, which gives ample time for reaction. No risk laterally.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 34.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = 14.61 m and DTClat = 0.17 m indicate it is moving close laterally, however the longitudinal distance is sufficient.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC_long = 14.61 m / 2.5 m/s = 5.84 s. The lateral movement is toward the left but the longitudinal component maintains a good distance.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 36.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = 14.61 m and DTClat = -21.14 m mean it is moving toward the vehicle while coming closer laterally as well.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC_long = 14.61 m / 2.5 m/s = 5.84 s, but the impending lateral motion poses an added risk.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 312.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = 11.12 m and DTClat = 28.95 m indicate safety distance.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC_long = 11.12 m / 2.5 m/s = 4.45 s giving enough time to react.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 330.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = 0.0 m and DTClat = 0.0 m indicates immediate danger of impact due to exact alignment.
  - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Since the distance is essentially zero, any movement forward will result in collision immediately.
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 341.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = -11.99 m indicates the obstacle is directly behind the car, creating a moderate risk.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk reason:  An obstacle moving towards from the back will not lead to a collision at this distance.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 361.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = 14.63 m and DTClat = 32.83 m indicate a safe distance.
  - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC_long = 14.63 m / 2.53 m/s = 5.78 s, sufficient time for potential maneuvers.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 365.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Similar to obstacle 361.0, it also presents a safe distance.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC_long = 18.3 m / 5.3 m/s = 3.45 s, providing reasonable time to react.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 369.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = 38.42 m with sufficient distance laterally.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC_long = 38.42 m / 5.83 m/s = 6.58 sâ€”ample time to react.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 371.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = 50.51 m maintains a safe margin.
  - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC_long = 50.51 m / 5.47 m/s = 9.23 s, leaving sufficient time to react or change course.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 5

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "330.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

### Summary:
There are no immediate collisions (Overall Risk Score 0), but there is one obstacle that poses an extreme risk (Overall Risk Score 1). The other obstacles have been assessed with various levels of risk based on their distance and time metrics.
