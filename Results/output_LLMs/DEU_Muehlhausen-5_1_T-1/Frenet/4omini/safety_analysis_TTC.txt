### Safety analysis for timestep 1.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 31.0
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 11.11 m longitudinally and 21.67 m laterally away. Despite being in the front-left and relatively close, the lateral separation is significant.
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal velocity is -2.5 m/s, resulting in a TTC of 4.44 seconds (TTC = Distance / |Velocity| = 11.11 / 2.5). The lateral TTC is infinite as there is no lateral movement relative to the ego vehicle.
  - Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **4**

- **Obstacle ID:** 34.0
  - Distance Risk reason: 14.61 m longitudinal and 0.17 m laterally, indicating a significant longitudinal distance but very close laterally.
  - Distance safety score: **3** (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The obstacle has a longitudinal TTC of 5.84 seconds (TTC = 14.61 / 2.5) and lateral movement increasing the distance. The lateral relative velocity is 2.42 m/s, leading to a lateral TTC of 0.07 seconds (TTC = 0.17 / 2.42) which is very concerning. 
  - Time safety score: **2** (High Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **2**

- **Obstacle ID:** 36.0
  - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is 14.61 m longitudinally and -21.14 m laterally—very distant longitudinally but significantly closer laterally to the right.
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC is 5.84 seconds and lateral movement toward the ego vehicle indicates potential risk, with a relative velocity of 0.71 m/s leading to a lateral TTC of 30.9 seconds.
  - Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **4**

- **Obstacle ID:** 312.0
  - Distance Risk reason: 11.12 m longitudinally and 28.95 m laterally; while longitudinally close, laterally, it is a safe distance.
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC is 4.44 seconds longitudinally (11.12 / 2.5). Lateral motion is zero, so no collision potential in lateral direction.
  - Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **4**

- **Obstacle ID:** 330.0
  - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is right on the collision zone (0.0 m longitudinal and lateral). Immediate collision is imminent.
  - Distance safety score: **0** (Collision Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: With a longitudinal velocity of 3.75 m/s (moving away from impact) and a lateral -0.28 m/s indicating some movement, this obstacle is in an unavoidable collision scenario.
  - Time safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **0**

- **Obstacle ID:** 341.0
  - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle (11.99 m longitudinally), indicating no potential collision risk.
  - Distance safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC is negative meaning it’s moving away; relative velocity indicates no risk to the ego vehicle.
  - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **5**

- **Obstacle ID:** 361.0
  - Distance Risk reason: An external obstacle at 14.63 m longitudinally and 32.83 m laterally is relatively safe.
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: With long TTC of 5.78 seconds longitudinally, it presents no immediate threat.
  - Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **4**

- **Obstacle ID:** 365.0
  - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is at a safe distance (18.3 m longitudinally and 6.55 m laterally).
  - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The longitudinal TTC is 3.45 seconds; however, every aspect seems manageable.
  - Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **4**

- **Obstacle ID:** 369.0
  - Distance Risk reason: 38.42 m longitudinally and no lateral risk at this distance.
  - Distance safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The high distance to collision indicates no threat.
  - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **5**

- **Obstacle ID:** 371.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Another distant obstacle at 50.51 m longitudinally and clear of impact.
  - Distance safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The overall distances coupled with low velocities lead to no risk.
  - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: **5**
