### Safety analysis for timestep 1.3: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 31.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located 11.11m longitudinally and 21.67m laterally in the front-left, posing no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -2.5 m/s, TTClong is approximately 4.44 seconds. No lateral relative motion.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 34.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located 14.61m longitudinally and very close (0.17m) laterally in the front-left, presenting a significant lateral risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -2.5 m/s (TTClong ~ 5.84s), but moving away laterally at 2.42 m/s. The small lateral distance raises concern despite the diverging lateral motion.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 36.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 14.61m longitudinally and 21.14m laterally in the front-right, providing a safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -2.5 m/s (TTClong ~ 5.84s) and laterally at 0.71 m/s, decreasing the lateral distance over time. 
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 312.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 11.12m longitudinally and 28.95m laterally in the front-left, posing no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -2.5 m/s (TTClong ~ 4.45s). No lateral relative motion.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 330.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located at 0m both longitudinally and laterally, indicating a collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Collision imminent.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 341.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 11.99m behind and directly behind (0m laterally), indicating a potential rear collision risk if the ego vehicle brakes suddenly.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving towards the ego vehicle from behind at 1.05 m/s, reducing the longitudinal distance, however, relative acceleration suggests ego is decelerating stronger than obstacle. The lateral movement is minimal.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 361.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 14.63m longitudinally and 32.83m laterally in front-left, representing a safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -2.53 m/s (TTClong ~ 5.78s) but moving away laterally at 4.56 m/s, further reducing risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 365.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 18.3m longitudinally and 6.55m laterally in front-left, which represents a moderate distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -5.3 m/s (TTClong ~ 3.45s) but moving away laterally at 3.81 m/s.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 369.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 38.42m longitudinally and directly in front, representing a safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching longitudinally at -5.83 m/s (TTClong ~ 6.58s), but relatively far.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 371.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located 50.51m longitudinally and directly in front, far enough to pose no immediate concern.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Approaching at -5.47m/s longitudinally (TTClong ~ 9.23s), but the distance provides ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
