Safety analysis for the last timestep (1.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 1.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

### Obstacle 31.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary and located in lanelet 4694, which is different from the ego vehicle's lanelet. The lateral and longitudinal distance is significant, reducing immediate risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Since the obstacle is stationary and located in another lanelet, there's no imminent time-based collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Obstacle 34.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is moving with a similar direction but is located in a different lanelet (6329). The distance from the ego vehicle suggests an adequate buffer.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Given its current velocity and directional movement, the TTC does not pose an immediate collision risk since the lanelets differ.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Obstacle 36.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is at a significant lateral distance in a different lanelet, 4696, with minimal crossing paths expected soon.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: With its low velocity and position, it does not represent a time-critical collision threat.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Obstacle 312.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Although in the same lanelet, it's distant from the ego vehicle and moving very slowly. 
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Minimal velocity and significant gap provide a low time-based collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Obstacle 330.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is in lanelet 4633, which indicates no immediate path crossing with the ego vehicle. Its velocity suggests maneuvering away from the potential path of the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: High velocity and differing initial path indicate minimal TTC concern for the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Obstacle 341.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in a different lanelet (4633), and its distance suggests it won’t be affecting the ego vehicle's trajectory directly.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: With its current speed in a different trajectory, there is no pressing time-based collision issue.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Obstacle 361.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle's location in lanelet 4693 and velocity suggest it's not immediately in the path of the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Despite considerable speed and differing path, no immediate TTC issue is identified.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Obstacle 365.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Different lanelet (6023) and significant path margin mean low collision risk potential.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: High velocity but in a trajectory avoiding immediate threat to the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Obstacle 369.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: In lanelet 4631, maintaining a location far from ego’s path with a projected moving out of trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Reduced acceleration and anticipated path avoid conflict with the ego vehicle in the near future.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Obstacle 371.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Lanelet 4631 alignment and position do not coincide directly with the ego vehicle’s prospective path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Moderate movement in parallel trajectory producing negligible collision time risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5
