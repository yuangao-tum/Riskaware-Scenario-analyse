Safety analysis for the last timestep (1.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 1.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories and vehicle dimensions aren't provided, we'll make simplifying assumptions for this analysis.  We'll treat vehicles as points and primarily use Euclidean distance for MDC approximations.  TTC will be estimated based on current velocities and closing speeds, acknowledging this is a simplification. A more rigorous analysis would require detailed trajectory predictions. We will define a safety threshold for distance and TTC based on general safety guidelines and assume a vehicle length of approximately 4 meters and a safe following distance of 2 seconds.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 31**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally separated and at a safe longitudinal distance.  DTClong > 20m, DTClat > 5m
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  No immediate time-based risk due to static nature and lateral separation. TTClong > 10s, TTClat >10s
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 34**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet but relatively close longitudinally.  DTClong ~19m, DTClat > 1m
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The ego vehicle and obstacle have similar velocities, reducing immediate risk. TTClong >10s, TTClat >10s
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 36**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally separated and at a safe longitudinal distance. DTClong ~15m, DTClat >25m
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  No immediate time-based risk due to lateral separation and moderate longitudinal separation. TTClong >10s, TTClat >10s
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 312**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally separated and at a safe longitudinal distance. DTClong >21m, DTClat > 7m
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is practically static, posing no immediate time-based risk. TTClong > 10s, TTClat >10s
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 330**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is close longitudinally and in the same lanelet. DTClong ~4.3m, DTClat ~0.8m
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle has much higher velocity than ego vehicle, potentially leading to a rapid decrease in longitudinal separation. TTClong ~0.7s, TTClat >10s
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 341**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is longitudinally separated and in the same lanelet. DTClong ~16.2m, DTClat ~3.5m
