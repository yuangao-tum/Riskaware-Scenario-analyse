Safety analysis for the last timestep (1.3 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario and evaluate collision risks:

### Safety Analysis:

1. First, identifying obstacles in ego vehicle's lanelet (4633, 5937):
- Obstacle 330 and 341 are in the same lanelet
- Other obstacles are in different lanelets

2. Detailed Analysis for relevant obstacles:

For Obstacle 330:
- Distance Risk reason: Vehicle is ahead in same lanelet, maintaining approximately 7-8m longitudinal distance
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity is higher (≈6.2 m/s vs 2.5 m/s), but increasing distance
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

For Obstacle 341:
- Distance Risk reason: Vehicle is ahead in same lanelet, maintaining safe distance (>10m)
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Similar velocity pattern (≈3.5 m/s vs 2.5 m/s), maintaining safe gap
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

Other vehicles:
- All other vehicles are in different lanelets with sufficient lateral separation
- No immediate collision risks identified
- Overall Risk scores: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Summary:

Based on the analysis:
1. No direct collision risks (score 0) identified
2. No extreme risks (score 1) identified
3. Main interaction is with vehicles 330 and 341, but they maintain safe distances and velocities

JSON Summary:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

The scenario shows good safety margins with all vehicles maintaining safe distances and velocities. The ego vehicle's trajectory and speed appear to be well-controlled with respect to surrounding traffic.
