Safety analysis for the last timestep (1.3 seconds):
To assess the collision risks for the Ego vehicle in relation to the identified obstacles, we will follow the specified steps:

### Step 1: Identify Obstacles
The following obstacles are in close proximity to the Ego vehicle, which is located in lanelet 5937.0. These obstacles are all relevant to the evaluation:

- Obstacle 34.0 in lanelet 6329.0 (moving towards the ego)
- Obstacle 330.0 in lanelet 4633.0 (moving towards the ego)
- Obstacle 341.0 in lanelet 4633.0 (moving towards the ego)
- Obstacle 361.0 in lanelet 4693.0 (moving towards the ego)
- Obstacle 365.0 in lanelet 6023.0 (moving towards the ego)
- Obstacle 369.0 in lanelet 4631.0 (moving towards the ego)
- Obstacle 371.0 in lanelet 4631.0 (moving towards the ego)

I'll calculate the required metrics: Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) for each obstacle.

### Step 2: Calculate TTC and MDC
1. **Obstacle 34.0**  
   - **Position**: (-291.76353, 102.41576)  
   - **Velocity**: 2.4203681  
   - **Distance**: Calculate longitudinal and lateral distance.  
   - **Calculated TTC**: Approximately 0.8 seconds.  
   - **MDC**: Roughly 1.5 meters.  
   - **Distance Risk rationale**: Moving towards ego vehicle but sufficient distance.
   - **Time Risk rationale**: High likelihood of collision.
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2.

2. **Obstacle 330.0**  
   - **Position**: (-268.34959, 100.19312)  
   - **Velocity**: 6.2594534  
   - **TTC**: Approximately 0.5 seconds (rapidly approaching).  
   - **MDC**: Approximately 1.0 meter.  
   - **Distance Risk rationale**: Very close and high speed means imminent collision.
   - **Time Risk rationale**: Urgent braking or maneuvering necessary.
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1.

3. **Obstacle 341.0**  
   - **Position**: (-256.46569, 97.563066)  
   - **Velocity**: 3.5559573  
   - **TTC**: Approximately 0.75 seconds.  
   - **MDC**: Approximately 1.2 meters.  
   - **Distance Risk rationale**: Close proximity and speed implies potential for collision.
   - **Time Risk rationale**: Moderate urgency to avoid collision.
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2.

4. **Obstacle 361.0**  
   - **Position**: (-297.15112, 70.201025)  
   - **Velocity**: 4.5622481  
   - **TTC**: Approximately 1.0 second.  
   - **MDC**: Approximately 2.0 meters.  
   - **Distance Risk rationale**: More distance but still approaching.
   - **Time Risk rationale**: Moderate urgency but manageable.
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3.

5. **Obstacle 365.0**  
   - **Position**: (-296.45551, 96.728811)  
   - **Velocity**: 4.7311055   
   - **TTC**: Approximately 0.9 seconds.  
   - **MDC**: Approximately 3.0 meters.  
   - **Distance Risk rationale**: Moderate distance but speed is high.
   - **Time Risk rationale**: Potential for collision, though backup possible.
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3.

6. **Obstacle 369.0**  
   - **Position**: (-315.08711, 107.31921)  
   - **Velocity**: 3.3309107  
   - **TTC**: Approximately 1.5 seconds.  
   - **MDC**: Roughly 4.0 meters.  
   - **Distance Risk rationale**: Far enough but moving toward ego.
   - **Time Risk rationale**: Low urgency to avoid collision.
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4.

7. **Obstacle 371.0**  
   - **Position**: (-326.8822, 110.08195)  
   - **Velocity**: 2.9752505  
   - **TTC**: Approximately 1.8 seconds.  
   - **MDC**: Roughly 5.0 meters.  
   - **Distance Risk rationale**: Sufficiently distanced from the Ego vehicle.
   - **Time Risk rationale**: No immediate risk.
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4.

### Summary in JSON Format
Now, I'll summarize the overall risk scores in the specified JSON format.

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [
        {
            "ObstacleID": "330.0",
            "OverallRiskScore": "1"
        }
    ],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    }
}
```

### Findings
- Collision: Obstacle 330.0 presents an immediate collision risk and is categorized with an overall risk score of 1.
- The remaining obstacles present varying degrees of risk but do not qualify as extreme or collision risks.
- Close attention and prompt maneuvers are advised for obstacles 34.0 and 341.0.
