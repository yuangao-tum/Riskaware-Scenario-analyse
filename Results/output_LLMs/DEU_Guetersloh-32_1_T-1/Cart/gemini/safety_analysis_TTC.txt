Safety analysis for the last timestep (1.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 1.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

It's important to note that with the provided data (positions, orientations, velocities, and accelerations at a single timestep), accurately calculating TTC and MDC is difficult.  True TTC and MDC calculations require predicting future trajectories, which involves assumptions about the future behavior of all actors. The following analysis provides estimates based on the instantaneous data provided, assuming constant velocity and no change in heading.  This is a simplification and might not reflect real-world behavior.

**Assumptions:** Constant velocity and straight-line trajectories.

**Methodology:**  A simplified approach will be used to estimate risk based on relative positions, velocities, and headings. A more comprehensive analysis would require integrating movement over time.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 31.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located laterally offset from the ego vehicle and moving in a different direction (different lanelets). While moderately close, the divergent trajectories suggest decreasing risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The differing trajectories and velocities suggest a low likelihood of collision.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 33.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located very close laterally to the ego vehicle in the same general direction but a different lanelet.  This presents a medium risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The similar longitudinal velocities and close proximity pose a medium risk if lane changes were to occur.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 35.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located laterally offset and slightly behind the ego vehicle.  The offset and ego vehicle's greater velocity lessen the risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The position and velocity difference suggest a low risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 37.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located significantly behind and offset from the ego vehicle. Poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The large distance and differing velocities indicate negligible risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 310.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind and offset from the ego vehicle. The distance and offset suggest low risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The position and velocity difference point towards a low risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 318.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located significantly behind the ego vehicle but heading towards its future path. Requires monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: While some distance away, its trajectory towards the ego vehicle's path requires attention.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


- **Obstacle ID: 319.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located far behind and laterally offset from the ego vehicle. Presents no immediate concern.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The large distance and different lanelet suggest minimal risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 331.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind and slightly offset from the ego vehicle.  The distance and offset suggest low risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The separation and slightly higher velocity of this obstacle reduce collision risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 338.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet, indicating minimal risk given current positions and trajectories.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The position, velocity, and lane difference suggest a low probability of collision.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 348.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Laterally close to the ego vehicle and stationary. The proximity raises concern, especially if the ego vehicle were to deviate from its current path.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The stationary nature and proximity of this obstacle mean the ego vehicle needs to maintain its course to avoid a collision.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
