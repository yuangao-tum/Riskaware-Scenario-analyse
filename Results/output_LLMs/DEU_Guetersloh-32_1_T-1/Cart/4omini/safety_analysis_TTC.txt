Safety analysis for the last timestep (1.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 1.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 31.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The ego vehicle's position (-342.6985, 613.0052) compared to the obstacle (-306.92368, 617.04249) shows a significant difference in the x-coordinates, creating a high lateral pressure despite a reasonable distance in the longitudinal position. However, the TTC will reveal more about the immediate risk.
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk: Close proximity but manageable)
   - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity indicates an imminent risk as the obstacle is traveling significantly faster and could close the gap quickly, giving a TTC of about 0.3 seconds.
   - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk: Immediate collision)

   - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 33.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The distance is manageable, but the obstacle is moving toward the ego vehicle. The small difference in orientation indicates consistent movement toward an intersection.
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The TTC indicates a possible collision within 1.1 seconds due to the similar speeds and directions of both vehicles.
   - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)

   - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 35.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The distance to this obstacle isnâ€™t as critical as others, but it creates a narrow space to maneuver within, thus posing risks to the future trajectory adjustments.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Given the relatively low-speed difference and distances, the TTC is around 1.5 seconds, allowing time to react successfully.
   - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)

   - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 37.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The distance is adequate, but the ego vehicle must be mindful of relative movement.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The collision time is roughly at 2.6, providing sufficient time to avoid a situation.
   - Time safety score: 4 (Negligible Risk)

   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 310.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: It appears to be in a safe lane given the distance maintained.
   - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The relative movement does not pose any immediate threats.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

   - Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID: 318.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: This vehicle is also a bit further away, presenting a low risk of interference.
   - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: No significant collision risk computed.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

   - Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

7. **Obstacle ID: 319.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Sufficient distance provides a buffer for safety.
   - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Risk of collision is well managed as their speeds are compatible.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

   - Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

8. **Obstacle ID: 331.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Feeds into the same lane, but at a reasonable distance matching movement patterns.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The time calculations show an effective buffer allowing a TTC of 2.3 seconds.
   - Time safety score: 4 (Negligible Risk)

   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

9. **Obstacle ID: 338.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The close distance to the ego vehicle presents significant risk.
   - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Its speed indicates a close potential for collision if not managed within 0.5 seconds.
   - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

   - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

10. **Obstacle ID: 348.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located sufficiently far from the ego vehicle ensuring safety.
    - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: No threat of collision projected given the static nature of this obstacle.
    - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

    - Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "31.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

This assessment clearly shows that the most critical risk to the ego vehicle comes from obstacles 31.0 and 338.0, with ample time available with appropriate reactions for the remaining obstacles.
