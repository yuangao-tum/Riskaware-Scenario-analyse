Safety analysis for the last timestep (1.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 1.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 31.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 31.0 is located ahead but a distance away in another lanelet. The longitudinal distance is significant, reducing immediate collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The velocity of the obstacle is significantly higher than the ego, and they are not on a converging path in the current setup.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 33.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 33.0 is in close proximity but slightly offset from the Ego's lanelet, contributing to low risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The speed differences may position them into a manageable trajectory alignment without risk of collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 35.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 35.0 is positioned further ahead with a different lanelet trajectory, making distance non-critical.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Obstacle moves slightly faster but at a safe lateral trajectory from the ego's path.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 37.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Farther ahead in a separate lanelet, reducing immediate collision concern.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Slower speed and diverging paths maintain a sufficient TTC.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 310.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 310.0 is farther but aligned in a way that minimises the collision risk due to lateral positioning.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The speed is lower, and the path does not converge dangerously with ego.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 318.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned noticeably ahead and on a separate trajectory in a different lanelet.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Higher speed but directed away from the immediate path of the ego vehicle.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 319.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Distant positioning reduces collision probability.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Low speed means that even with current velocities, they do not converge dangerously for the ego.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 331.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Far from ego and different lanes contribute to a safe margin.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Path and speed parameters prevent any immediate collision risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 338.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: At some distance, moving at a similar orientation but different lanelet.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Orientation combined with speed differences indicate control over trajectory, limiting collision chance.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 348.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle ahead and in another lane reduces likelihood of collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Not moving, hence no immediate risk of changing current trajectory in collision-prone manner.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4
