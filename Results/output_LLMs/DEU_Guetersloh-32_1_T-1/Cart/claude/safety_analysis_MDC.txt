Safety analysis for the last timestep (1.7 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario for collision risks:

1. First, identifying vehicles in the same lanelet (77979.0, 78281.0) or adjacent lanelets as the ego vehicle:
- Obstacle 33.0: Same lanelet (77979.0)
- Obstacle 35.0: Same lanelet (77979.0)
- Obstacle 37.0: Same lanelet (77979.0)
- Obstacle 310.0: Same lanelet (77979.0)

2. Detailed Analysis:

For Obstacle 33.0:
- Initial distance: ~3.5m
- Relative velocity: Higher (increasing from 2.02 to 4.58 m/s)
- TTC: Approximately 2-3 seconds
- Distance safety score: 2 (High risk due to close proximity)
- Time safety score: 2 (High risk due to closing velocity)
- Overall Risk score: 2

For Obstacle 35.0:
- Initial distance: ~6.5m
- Relative velocity: Higher (increasing from 1.32 to 3.89 m/s)
- TTC: Approximately 3-4 seconds
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium risk)
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3

For Obstacle 37.0:
- Initial distance: ~17.3m
- Relative velocity: Similar range
- TTC: >5 seconds
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low risk)
- Time safety score: 4 (Low risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4

For Obstacle 310.0:
- Initial distance: ~10.4m
- Relative velocity: Similar range
- TTC: >5 seconds
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low risk)
- Time safety score: 4 (Low risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4

No immediate collisions (score 0) or extreme risks (score 1) were detected, though Obstacle 33.0 presents the highest risk due to its close proximity and increasing relative velocity.

Key Findings:
1. The ego vehicle is accelerating from ~0.9 m/s to 3.4 m/s
2. Multiple vehicles are in the same lanelet, but maintaining safe distances
3. Obstacle 33.0 requires closest monitoring due to increasing relative velocity
4. No immediate collision risks identified, but caution is warranted
