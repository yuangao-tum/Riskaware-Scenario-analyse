### Safety analysis for timestep 1.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 31.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance of 8.55 m and lateral distance of 31.94 m indicate the vehicle is relatively far from the obstacle. However, since the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally, there could be potential risk.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The longitudinal relative velocity of -8.14 m/s suggests that a collision is possible but not imminent, allowing for some maneuvers. Lateral motion is moving away.
  - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 33.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance of -0.18 m indicates very close proximity, suggesting a potential immediate collision situation. The lateral distance is negligible (0.0 m).
  - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: There is a positive relative velocity of 1.14 m/s towards the ego vehicle. Given the very close distance, collision is highly probable.
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 35.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance of -8.22 m suggests proximity but is further back compared to 33.0. The lateral distance is also negligible (0.0 m).
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The positive relative velocity of 0.45 m/s towards the ego vehicle indicates a possible collision path, though the risk is lower than with 33.0.
  - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 37.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance of -34.69 m means the vehicle is further away, and lateral distance is 0.0 m which still puts it in alignment but moving away longitudinally.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The vehicle is actually moving away. With a negative longitudinal relative velocity, it's decreasing the chance of collision.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 310.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance of -16.51 m indicates a greater safety margin. Lateral distance 0.0 m also leaves it aligned but moving away.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The negative relative velocity indicates the obstacle is moving away, representing less risk of collision.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 318.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance of -35.59 m and lateral distance of 3.04 m suggest it's comfortably away from the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The obstacle's negative velocity indicates it's moving away, thus reducing collision potential.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 319.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance of -46.05 m and lateral distance of 0.85 m mean it is further away. The aligned motion maintains a low risk of collision.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: With both velocity components being negative or zero, the chances of collision remain negligible.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 331.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: A longitudinal distance of -20.49 m shows a fair distance. Lateral distance of 2.42 m provides extra margin.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The negative values in both velocity components suggests the obstacle is also moving away, further lowering collision likelihood.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 338.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance of 8.07 m shows it is fairly close, and with a lateral distance of 0.39 m, it may also bring some risks.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Given a negative relative velocity (longitudinal -11.92 m/s), there's significant movement towards impact. 
  - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 348.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: With a longitudinal distance of 6.72 m and a lateral distance of 25.87 m, risk is moderate but manageable due to distance.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: The negative relative velocity (-3.44 m/s) indicates potential for collision but less risk given distance.
  - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)
