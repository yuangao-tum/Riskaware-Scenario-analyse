### Safety analysis for timestep 1.7 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 31.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = 8.55 m (approaching), DTClat = 31.94 m (far). 
   - Distance safety score: **3** (Medium Risk).
   - Time Risk reason: TTC_long = 1.05 s (collision is likely), TTC_lat = 1.78 s (controllable), approach makes this a medium risk overall.
   - Time safety score: **3** (Medium Risk).
   - Overall Risk score: **3** (Medium Risk).

2. **Obstacle ID: 33.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = -0.18 m (very close, likely collision) and DTClat = 0.0 m (exactly behind). 
   - Distance safety score: **2** (High Risk).
   - Time Risk reason: TTC_long = 0.16 s (immediate risk of rear-end collision), TTC_lat is irrelevant as the obstacle is behind.
   - Time safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk).
   - Overall Risk score: **1** (Extreme Risk).

3. **Obstacle ID: 35.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = -8.22 m (positive indicates moving away), DTClat = 0.0 m (exactly behind).
   - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk).
   - Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away longitudinally, can control movement with distance increases.
   - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk).
   - Overall Risk score: **4** (Low Risk).

4. **Obstacle ID: 37.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = -34.69 m (moving away) and DTClat = 0.0 m (far behind). 
   - Distance safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk).
   - Time Risk reason: The obstacle is clearly moving away slowly, no collision risk.
   - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk).
   - Overall Risk score: **5** (Negligible Risk).

5. **Obstacle ID: 310.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = -16.51 m (moving away) and DTClat = 0.0 m (far behind).
   - Distance safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk).
   - Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away.
   - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk).
   - Overall Risk score: **5** (Negligible Risk).

6. **Obstacle ID: 318.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = -35.59 m (moving away) and DTClat = 3.04 m (far behind left).
   - Distance safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk).
   - Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away.
   - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk).
   - Overall Risk score: **5** (Negligible Risk).

7. **Obstacle ID: 319.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = -46.05 m (moving away) and DTClat = 0.85 m (far left behind). 
   - Distance safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk).
   - Time Risk reason: Phase of movement indicates a lack of impact risk.
   - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk).
   - Overall Risk score: **5** (Negligible Risk).

8. **Obstacle ID: 331.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = -20.49 m (moving away) and DTClat = 2.42 m (far left behind).
   - Distance safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk).
   - Time Risk reason: Safe movements are noted; sufficient distance prevents collision.
   - Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk).
   - Overall Risk score: **5** (Negligible Risk).

9. **Obstacle ID: 338.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = 8.07 (approaching) and DTClat = 0.39 m (left to the front).
   - Distance safety score: **3** (Medium Risk).
   - Time Risk reason: TTC_long = 0.68 s (likelihood of impact), TTC_lat is less critical as the diagonal movement is slightly manageable.
   - Time safety score: **2** (High Risk).
   - Overall Risk score: **2** (High Risk).

10. **Obstacle ID: 348.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: DTClong = 6.72 m (approaching) and DTClat = 25.87 m (far). 
    - Distance safety score: **3** (Medium Risk).
    - Time Risk reason: TTC_long = 1.95 s (need to consider relative speeds for predictions).
    - Time safety score: **3** (Medium Risk).
    - Overall Risk score: **3** (Medium Risk).
