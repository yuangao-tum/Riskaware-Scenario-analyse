### Safety analysis for timestep 1.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 31.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Laterally far away (31.94m), but longitudinally close (8.55m) and closing (-8.14 m/s).  
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally, TTClong = 1.05s. Lateral motion is away from ego.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 33.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close longitudinally (-0.18m, effectively behind ego already) and laterally aligned.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally from behind, TTClong = -0.16s (already overlapping).
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 35.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Longitudinally close (-8.22m, behind) and laterally aligned.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Approaching from behind, TTClong = -18.27s (meaning it's moving slower than ego, but still a risky position).
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 37.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately far behind (-34.69m) and laterally aligned.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally. TTClong=52.56s.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 310.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately far behind (-16.51m) and laterally aligned.
- Distance safety score: 3
