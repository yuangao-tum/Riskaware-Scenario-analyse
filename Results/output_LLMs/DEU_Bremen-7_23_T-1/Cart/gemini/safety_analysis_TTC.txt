Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.9 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.9: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories, dimensions of vehicles, and lanelet geometries aren't provided, I'm making simplified assumptions for this analysis:  I'm treating vehicles as points and focusing on Euclidean distances.  A more robust analysis would require incorporating vehicle shapes, lane boundaries, and predicting future trajectories. TTC is approximated based on current velocities and assuming constant velocity. MDC is approximated as the current Euclidean distance.  Thresholds for risk levels based on TTC and distance will need to be calibrated based on the specific autonomous driving system requirements. For this example, I'm using approximate thresholds.

**Thresholds (Illustrative):**

* **TTC:** < 2 seconds: Extreme Risk, 2-4 seconds: High Risk, 4-6 seconds: Medium Risk, >6 seconds: Low Risk
* **MDC:** < 5 meters: Extreme Risk, 5-10 meters: High Risk, 10-20 meters: Medium Risk, > 20 meters: Low Risk
