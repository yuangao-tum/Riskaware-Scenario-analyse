### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

In conclusion, all obstacles present negligible collision risks as they are either moving in separate trajectories, are stationary, or located in different lanelets. The Overall Risk Scores consistently indicate minimal to no chance of incidents.
