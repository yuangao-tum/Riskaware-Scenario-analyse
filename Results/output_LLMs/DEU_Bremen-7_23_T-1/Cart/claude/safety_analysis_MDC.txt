Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.9 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario for potential collisions:

### Safety Analysis:

1. **Ego Vehicle (30305.0)**:
- Located in lanelet 553.0 initially, moving to 1698.0
- Position from (49.6763, 336.747) to (79.3185, 323.6528)
- Velocity decreasing from 13.9522 to 3.4376

2. **Key Risk Obstacles**:

**Obstacle 30304.0**:
- Distance Risk: High risk due to sharing same lanelet (553.0/1698.0) and close proximity
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk: Medium risk with decreasing relative velocity
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 2

**Obstacle 30306.0**:
- Distance Risk: Moderate risk, following in same lanelet
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk: Low risk due to maintaining safe distance
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

**Obstacle 30303.0**:
- Distance Risk: Medium risk, crossing trajectory
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk: Medium risk due to intersecting path
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

3. **Other Obstacles**:
Most other obstacles maintain safe distances and are in different lanelets with minimal risk of collision.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Key Findings:
1. While there are several obstacles in proximity, none present immediate collision risk (score 0) or extreme risk (score 1)
2. The ego vehicle's decreasing velocity helps maintain safe distances
3. Main attention should be paid to obstacle 30304.0 which shares the same lanelet
4. The scenario shows managed risk levels with no imminent collision threats

The analysis shows that while there are obstacles in proximity, the situation maintains controllable risk levels with no immediate collision threats. The ego vehicle's controlled deceleration contributes to maintaining safe distances.
