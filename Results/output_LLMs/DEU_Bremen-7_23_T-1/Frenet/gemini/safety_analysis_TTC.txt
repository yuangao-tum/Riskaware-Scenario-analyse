### Safety analysis for timestep 4.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**General Considerations:**  Since precise TTC and MDC calculations require complex trajectory predictions and aren't directly derivable from the given instantaneous values, we'll use a qualitative approach.  The relative velocity and acceleration, combined with distance, will inform the risk assessment.  A negative relative longitudinal velocity indicates the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally. A negative lateral velocity signifies the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle from the specified side (left or right).

- **Obstacle ID: 30292.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Moderately far, but approaching longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching, requires monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30293.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Far, but lateral movement towards ego vehicle is a concern.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Closing in, lateral movement increases risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30294.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Similar to 30292, moderately far but approaching with slight lateral movement.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching, monitoring necessary.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30295.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively close, longitudinal and lateral movement towards ego increases risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Approaching, situation demands attention. Negative longitudinal acceleration might mitigate the risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30296.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Similar to 30295.0, concerning proximity with both longitudinal and lateral closing motion.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Requires attention due to the closing distance, but negative longitudinal acceleration might mitigate the risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30297.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Far, lateral movement is not immediately concerning.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Large closing velocity longitudinally needs observation, lateral movement is towards the ego car.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30298.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Quite close longitudinally, requires attention. No lateral relative motion.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Very close, high risk if closing velocity maintains. No lateral motion mitigates the risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30299.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Very close, immediate concern, but slightly moving away laterally to the right.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Approaching fast, highest risk. The fact that itâ€™s almost directly in front and moving away laterally slightly decreases the risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30300.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Far, provides time to react. Lateral movement towards ego vehicle needs monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Closing, observe for changes in lateral velocity.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


- **Obstacle ID: 30301.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Furthest obstacle, lowest immediate risk, but monitoring of lateral speed might be needed.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Closing but at a moderate rate.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 30302.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately far, but approaching both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Closing. Requires observation.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


- **Obstacle ID: 30303.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Moving away, safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away, no risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


- **Obstacle ID: 30304.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Very close, high risk.
- Distance safety score: 1
