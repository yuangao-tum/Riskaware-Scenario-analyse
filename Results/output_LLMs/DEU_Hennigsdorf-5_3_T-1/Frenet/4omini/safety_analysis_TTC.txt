### Safety analysis for timestep 2.8 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The distance to the obstacle is 1.63 m laterally and 0.0 m longitudinally. This indicates that the obstacle is in very close proximity to the ego vehicle, which could pose a collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk) – Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact.
  - **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocity is -1.69 m/s longitudinally, indicating the obstacle is getting closer. Given the proximity, the time to collision is effectively very short; TTC = Distance / Velocity = 0.0 / -1.69 = Undefined (immediate collision).
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk).
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk).

- **Obstacle ID:** 31.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The distance to the obstacle is 1.53 m longitudinally and 1.65 m laterally. This presents a very short distance where a collision can occur.
  - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk) – Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact.
  - **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocity is also -1.69 m/s longitudinally. With a TTC effectively calculated as 1.53 / -1.69 ≈ 0.91 seconds, which is critically short considering its very close proximity.
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk).
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk).

- **Obstacle ID:** 36.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The distance to the obstacle is 1.66 m laterally and 8.39 m longitudinally, indicating it's out of immediate collision range but still poses a risk as it is approaching.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk) – Moderate collision risk but manageable.
  - **Time Risk reason:** With a longitudinal velocity of -1.69 m/s; TTC = 8.39 / |-1.69| ≈ 4.97 seconds, indicating that there is still time to react although a collision is probable if no inputs are made.
  - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk).
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk).

- **Obstacle ID:** 37.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle has a longitudinal distance of -21.38 m and a lateral distance of 16.52 m, indicating it's far behind and well out of the way.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk) – No significant collision risk.
  - **Time Risk reason:** The relative motion shows the obstacle is moving away; danger of collision is exceedingly low.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk).
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk).

- **Obstacle ID:** 314.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance of -22.99 m and lateral distance of 20.67 m indicate a distant position, not likely to involve a collision.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk).
  - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is moving away; thus, the risk of collision is very low.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk).
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk).

- **Obstacle ID:** 322.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** With a longitudinal distance of -21.24 m and a lateral distance of 36.44 m, this obstacle is far and presents no immediate threat.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk).
  - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is also moving away, indicating low risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk).
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk).

- **Obstacle ID:** 338.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance of 25.67 m and laterally 0.0 m, which indicates movement away; no immediate risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk).
  - **Time Risk reason:** Here, the high relative longitudinal velocity indicates no risk; the expiration period before any potential impact is long.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk).
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk).

- **Obstacle ID:** 341.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance is -24.24 m with lateral movement and indicates far behind the ego vehicle; no immediate threat.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk).
  - **Time Risk reason:** Again, as this obstacle is moving away from the vehicle, the collision risk remains minimal.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk).
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk).

- **Obstacle ID:** 342.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is at collision distance (0.0 m, 0.0 m); hence there’s an immediate threat.
  - **Distance safety score:** 0 (Collision) – Immediate collision.
  - **Time Risk reason:** The scenario denotes a collision course as TTC is effectively 0.
  - **Time safety score:** 0 (Collision).
  - **Overall Risk score:** 0 (Collision).

- **Obstacle ID:** 343.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The overall longitudinal position indicates it is well behind, posing no immediate danger.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk).
  - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is moving away longitudinally; thus, it's not a threat.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk).
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk).

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "342.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

In this scenario, we have identified Collision and Extreme Risk obstacles, both of which require immediate attention to avoid potential collisions. The analysis highlights that there are no additional extreme risk (1) obstacles aside from the immediate collision (0) scenario presented.
