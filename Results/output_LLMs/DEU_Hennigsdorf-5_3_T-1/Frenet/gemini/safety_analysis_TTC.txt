### Safety analysis for timestep 2.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located very close laterally (1.63m) to the ego vehicle, essentially alongside, while longitudinally aligned (0.0m).  This presents a high risk of collision, especially given the slight lateral closing velocity.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: While longitudinally aligned, the lateral relative velocity is small and negative (-0.0 m/s), suggesting minimal immediate lateral movement. However, the small lateral distance raises concern.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 31.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Situated very close to the ego vehicle, both longitudinally (1.53m) and laterally (1.65m). This proximity poses a significant collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  The negative longitudinal relative velocity (-1.69 m/s) indicates the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle, further increasing the risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 36.0**
- Distance Risk reason: While further away longitudinally (8.39m) than obstacle 31, it's still relatively close laterally (1.66m), placing it in a potential collision path.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Similar to obstacle 31, the negative longitudinal relative velocity (-1.69 m/s) suggests an approaching obstacle, increasing risk over time.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 37.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located far behind (-21.38m) and to the left (16.52m) of the ego vehicle, posing no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While moving slightly closer longitudinally (-1.27 m/s), the large initial distance mitigates any immediate risk.  The lateral movement towards the ego vehicle warrants monitoring.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 314.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Positioned far behind (-22.99m) and to the left (20.67m), presenting no immediate danger.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Similar to obstacle 37, the longitudinal and lateral movements don't pose an immediate threat due to the substantial initial distance.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 322.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Situated far behind (-21.24m) and to the left (36.44m), presenting no immediate danger.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The current distance and velocities suggest no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


- **Obstacle ID: 338.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located far ahead (25.67m) and longitudinally aligned (0.0m) with the ego vehicle, posing no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle (13.58 m/s), further reducing any potential risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 341.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Positioned far behind (-24.24m) and to the right (-13.42m) of the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally, minimizing any potential future risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


- **Obstacle ID: 342.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Reported as in direct "Collision" with the ego vehicle (0.0m longitudinal and lateral distance), indicating a collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason:  The collision state confirms a TTC of zero.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 343.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located far behind (-24.58m) and longitudinally aligned with the ego vehicle, presenting no immediate danger.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Moving away from the ego vehicle, further reducing any potential risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
