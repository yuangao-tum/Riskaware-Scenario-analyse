### Safety analysis for timestep 2.8: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 30.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: DTClong is 0.0 m, DTClat is 1.63 m indicates immediate proximity.
  - Distance safety score: 0 (collision imminent).
  - Time Risk reason: TTC is calculated as -0.0 seconds (collision imminent).
  - Time safety score: 1 (immediate collision risk).
  - Overall Risk score: 0 (collision).

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 31.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: DTClong is 1.53 m, DTClat is 1.65 m shows a close distance.
  - Distance safety score: 1 (high risk due to close proximity).
  - Time Risk reason: TTC is calculated as -0.017 seconds (very high likelihood of collision).
  - Time safety score: 1 (immediate collision risk).
  - Overall Risk score: 1 (extreme risk).

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 36.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: DTClong is 8.39 m, DTClat is 1.66 m indicates moderate distance from the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (medium risk but manageable).
  - Time Risk reason: TTC is -0.054 seconds; while closer than threshold, it shows moderate risk.
  - Time safety score: 1 (immediate collision risk).
  - Overall Risk score: 1 (extreme risk).

#### Obstacle Analysis:
