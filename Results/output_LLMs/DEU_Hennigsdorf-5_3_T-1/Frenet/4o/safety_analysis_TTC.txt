### Safety analysis for timestep 2.8: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
#### Obstacle ID: 30.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The lateral distance is 1.63m, which is relatively close considering the zero longitudinal distance; the lateral proximity poses a slight risk due to very close proximity in adjacent lane but not directly aligned.
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: With a relative velocity of 1.69 m/s towards the ego car longitudinally, the TTC longitudinal is undefined due to zero longitudinal distance, indicating potential immediate collision path. However, lateral movement is less threatening at this moment but might need prompt attention.
- **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 31.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The real distance is 1.53m longitudinally and 1.65m laterally, indicating proximity in both directions.
- **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative longitudinal velocity indicates the obstacle is on a collision course at 1.69 m/s; thus, quick maneuvering is required.
- **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 36.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The real distance is 8.39m longitudinally and 1.66m laterally, moderate proximity in front but manageable.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Given a relative velocity of 1.69 m/s, the obstacle approaches but not immediately. The situation is manageable with appropriate reaction time.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 37.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located significantly laterally at 16.52m and longitudinally at -21.38m, moving away laterally and longitudinally.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: No TTC risk due to negative velocity in relation to the ego vehicle's path, indicating no immediate concern.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 314.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Large distance both laterally (20.67m) and longitudinally (-22.99m), with lateral movement away.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: As with obstacle 37.0, there is no risk of a collision due to negative velocity concerning ego trajectory.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 322.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Significant lateral distance (36.44m) and longitudinal displacement (-21.24m), moving away.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Similar reasoning as obstacles 37.0 and 314.0, no potential collision risk observed.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 338.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The largest distance longitudinally at 25.67m and aligned laterally at 0.0m, moving away.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Positive velocity suggests it's continuing to move ahead substantially faster, reducing collision likelihood.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 341.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Substantial distance both laterally (-13.42m) and longitudinally (-24.24m), moving away in both respects.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Moving away implies no immediate collision risk observed with a steady retreat path.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 342.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Exists directly aligned longitudinally and laterally (0m, 0m), indicating collision presence.
- **Distance safety score**: 0 (Collision)
- **Time Risk reason**: The longitudinal velocity implies substantial risk, managed only through immediate correction to the vehicle's path.
- **Time safety score**: 0 (Collision)
- **Overall Risk score**: 0 (Collision)

#### Obstacle ID: 343.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Directly behind at 24.58m, no significant lateral influence.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Moving away longitudinally with lateral alignment implies no collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
