Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.8 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since precise trajectories and obstacle dimensions aren't provided,  I'm making assumptions based on relative positions, orientations, and velocities. A more accurate analysis would require this missing information.  I'm assuming a collision is possible if the vehicles' paths intersect based on current information.
* "Longitudinal" TTC/MDC refers to the direction of the ego vehicle's travel, and "lateral" refers to the perpendicular direction.  Because precise trajectories aren't provided, these are approximations.
* I'm interpreting "Overall Risk Score" as the minimum of the Time and Distance Risk Scores.  If either time or distance suggests a high risk, the overall risk is high.

**Calculations** (Illustrative - precise calculations require more data):

Example for Obstacle 342:

* **Distance:**  Obstacle 342 is in the same lanelet and close to the ego vehicle. Approximate Euclidean distance is  sqrt((126.5262 - 122.3586)^2 + (-707.8932 - (-707.86766))^2) ≈ 4.17 meters. This is dangerously close.
* **TTC:** Both vehicles are moving forward, with the obstacle's speed greater. The closing speed is high (11.21 - 1.69 ≈ 9.52 m/s). Combined with the small distance, this yields a very low TTC (≈ 0.44 seconds).


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30**
- Distance Risk reason: In the adjacent lane and somewhat close laterally.  Longitudinal distance is moderate.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Stationary, but ego vehicle is moving forward, so low risk assuming the ego vehicle maintains course.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 31**
- Distance Risk reason: In the adjacent lane and further away than obstacle 30.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 36**
- Distance Risk reason:  In the adjacent lane and further away than obstacle 31.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 37**
