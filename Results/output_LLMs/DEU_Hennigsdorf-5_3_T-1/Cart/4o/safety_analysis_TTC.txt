Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.8 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.8: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is relatively close to the ego vehicle laterally, which may pose a risk. However, it is not moving.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** With the obstacle stationary, the TTC is indefinite, as there is no relative velocity change.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 31.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned slightly ahead of the ego vehicle; however, stationary.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Stationary obstacle means indefinite TTC.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 36.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Farther down the path with zero velocity, presenting minimal risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** No velocity implies no immediate threat of collision in time dimensions.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 37.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Given its velocity and direction, it's moving away; therefore, lesser risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Relatively low risk in the time domain due to its trajectory heading away.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 314.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Path and distance pose no close threat with its current trajectory away from the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Low velocity and perpendicular path risk reduced over time.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 322.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Significantly distant and positioned away, presenting no material risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Low speed and distant position ensure safety in time iterations.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 338.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned in the same lanelet as the ego and approaching rapidly.
  - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** High-speed closing immensity poses an urgent short TTC.
  - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 341.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Though fast-moving, the lateral distance minimizes the direct risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** High velocity, but the trajectory doesn't interact threateningly.
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 342.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Moving fast and close in the ego's lanelet.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Fast approach reduces TTC considerably.
  - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 343.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** High speed might pose a risk if trajectory intersects soon.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** TTC is reduced if paths align shortly.
  - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
