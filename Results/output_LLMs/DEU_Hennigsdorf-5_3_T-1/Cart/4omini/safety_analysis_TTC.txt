Safety analysis for the last timestep (2.8 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 2.8 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Ego Vehicle Position:** (126.5262, -707.8932)  
**Ego Velocity:** 1.6862 m/s (in a negative orientation)

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The ego vehicle is relatively close, but the obstacle is stationary, leading to a high chance of proximity collision.
   - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Since the obstacle is stationary, the TTC is immediate, indicating a high likelihood of collision if no action is taken.
   - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 31.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Similar to Obstacle 30.0, this obstacle is also stationary and near the path.
   - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The same reasoning as above applies here, with a high chance of collision.
   - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 36.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is also stationary and nearby, which poses a significant risk.
   - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The ego vehicle's movement towards this obstacle raises concerns for collision.
   - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 338.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is moving at 15.27 m/s towards the ego vehicle's lane, which drastically increases collision risk.
   - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: High TTC because it's coming into the ego's path very quickly.
   - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 342.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Itâ€™s also moving fast and is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle.
   - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The egos position and speed relative to the obstacle imply an immediate risk of collision.
   - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID: 341.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle moves at 7.93 m/s towards the same or adjacent lane possibly leading to a collision.
   - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Very likely to collide based on their velocities and orientations.
   - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

7. **Obstacle ID: 37.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: This vehicle is moving away at a higher speed; therefore, the proximity is less concerning.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The speed indicates a manageable situation; however, caution is still needed.
   - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

8. **Obstacle ID: 314.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Same reasoning as for Obstacle 37.0; this object is moving away, which suggests less imminent danger.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Relatively lower risk due to movement and distance increase.
   - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

9. **Obstacle ID: 322.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Positioned far relative to the ego vehicle, thus establishing a safer distance, though cautious.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Vehicle's slow speed implies that any risk can be managed.
   - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

10. **Obstacle ID: 343.0**
    - Distance Risk reason: Closely located however, it's moving in a separate lane.
    - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: The velocity of this obstacle suggests it can be avoided with proper navigation.
    - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json

}
``` 

### Summary:
- Immediate collision risks exist with Obstacle IDs 30.0, 31.0, 36.0, 338.0, 341.0, and 342.0, all rated with an Overall Risk score of 1.
- There are several obstacles (37.0, 314.0, 322.0, 343.0) that have a lower risk profile but should still be monitored closely, rated Overall Risk scores of 3. 
- Actions need to be taken immediately to mitigate the immediate risks associated with the identified obstacles particularly the static and fast-moving vehicles in overlapping paths.
