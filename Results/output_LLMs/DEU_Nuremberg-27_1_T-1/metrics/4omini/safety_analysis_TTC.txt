Safety analysis for timestep 5.3 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30622
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: The longitudinal distance to collision is quite significant at 23.39m, indicating a low risk of collision, but the lateral distance is 53.66m, which also indicates minimal risk. Hence the DTC scores are safe.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5 (rounded down to 4)
- Time Risk Reason: The longitudinal time to collision is 5.28s, which is safe. Lateral time to collision is infinite indicating no lateral threat. Thus the TTC scores are low risk.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4  
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5 (rounded down to 4)
- Overall Risk Score: 4 (based on the average of DSC and TSC)

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30623
- Relative Direction: Front
- Distance Risk Reason: The longitudinal distance to collision is 16.71m, which poses a low risk. However, the lateral distance is 0.0m, indicating a substantial lateral collision risk.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 2 (Since LatDSC = 0, dominates the score)
- Time Risk Reason: The longitudinal time to collision is 4.84 seconds, which is safe. However, the lateral time is 0.0 seconds, indicating an imminent risk of collision.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4  
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 2 (Since LatTSC = 0, dominates the score)
- Overall Risk Score: 2 (based on the average of DSC and TSC)

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30624
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance is 27.92m - low risk, and lateral distance is 37.91m - low risk as well.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4
- Time Risk Reason: The longitudinal time to collision is 3.34 seconds, and no lateral threat since time is infinite.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3  
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4 (weighted by 0.5)
- Overall Risk Score: 4

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30625
- Relative Direction: Left
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance is 0.0m indicating immediate collision risk along this dimension, while the lateral distance is 1.95m indicating poor lateral space.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 2
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 0 (Since LongDSC = 0 dominates)
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal time to collision is 0.0 seconds signifies an imminent collision threat, whereas lateral time is infinite meaning no risk.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0  
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 2.5 (but rounded down because of 0)
- Overall Risk Score: 0 (based on the average of DSC and TSC)

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30626
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance to collision is 10.03m (safe), and lateral distance to collision is 1.83m, which poses some risk.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 3  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 2
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 2.5 (rounded down to 2)
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal time is 0.85 seconds (risky), and infinite lateral time suggests minimal lateral concern.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 2  
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 3.5 (rounded down to 3)
- Overall Risk Score: 2

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30628
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance to collision is 0.18m, indicating immediate collision threat, and lateral distance is 0.0m, which also indicates collision risk.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 0 (Due to both DSC = 0)
- Time Risk Reason: Both longitudinal and lateral times to collision are also at 0.0 seconds indicating a very high certainty of collision.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0  
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Risk Score: 0 (based on the average - collision)

### Summary in JSON Format:
