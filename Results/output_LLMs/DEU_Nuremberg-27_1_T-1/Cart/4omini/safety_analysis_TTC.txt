Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.3 seconds):
### Step 1: Identify Obstacles in the Same Lanelet or Trajectory

In the provided scenario, we need to analyze the obstacles that are within the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (Lanelet 913.0). The relevant obstacles are:

- **Obstacle 30623.0** (Position: (288.0825, 268.8859), Lanelet 913.0)
- **Obstacle 30625.0** (Position: (307.9194, 257.7557), Lanelet 912.0)
- **Obstacle 30626.0** (Position: (293.1485, 263.313), Lanelet 912.0)
- **Obstacle 30624.0** (Position: (263.9109, 235.6283), Lanelet 1842.0)
- **Obstacle 30622.0** (Position: (262.7195, 219.2801), Lanelet 497.0)
- **Obstacle 30628.0** (Position: (312.3317, 259.777), Lanelet 913.0)

From the list, **Obstacle 30623.0** and **Obstacle 30628.0** are in Lanelet 913.0.

### Step 2: Calculate Metrics

#### Common Parameters

- **Ego Vehicle Position**: (307.9825, 261.5236)
- **Ego Velocity**: 3.4531 m/s
  
#### Metrics for Each Obstacle

1. **Obstacle ID: 30623.0**
   - Position: (288.0825, 268.8859)
   - Velocity: 0.0
   - Distance calculation:
     - Longitudinal: 307.9825 - 288.0825 = 19.9 m
     - Lateral: 261.5236 - 268.8859 = -7.3623 m
     - Distance = √(19.9² + (-7.3623)²) ≈ 21.26 m
   - **TTC Calculation**: Since obstacle is stationary, TTC = distance / ego velocity = 21.26 / 3.4531 ≈ 6.16 seconds.
   - **MDC**: 21.26 m

2. **Obstacle ID: 30628.0**
   - Position: (312.3317, 259.777)
   - Velocity: 6.1303
   - Distance calculation:
     - Longitudinal: 312.3317 - 307.9825 = 4.3492 m
     - Lateral: 259.777 - 261.5236 = -1.7466 m
     - Distance = √(4.3492² + (-1.7466)²) ≈ 4.508 m
   - **TTC Calculation**: TTC = distance / relative speed,
   - Speed of ego relative to obstacle = ego velocity (3.4531) + obstacle velocity (6.1303) = 9.5834 m/s,
   - TTC = 4.508 / 9.5834 ≈ 0.47 seconds.
   - **MDC**: 4.508 m 

### Step 3: Evaluation

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30623.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The distance of 21.26 m indicates that it is not currently a threat.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk, sufficient distance to react).
   - Time Risk reason: With a TTC of 6.16 seconds, there is plenty of time to maneuver.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk, ample time to react).
   - Overall Risk score: The lowest score between distance and time safety scores, which is 4.

2. **Obstacle ID: 30628.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The distance of 4.508 m indicates a potential risk of collision as it is relatively close.
   - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk, at a dangerous distance).
   - Time Risk reason: With a TTC of 0.47 seconds, immediate action is required to avoid collision.
   - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk, severely low time to react).
   - Overall Risk score: The lowest score between distance and time safety scores, which is 1.
