Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30622.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (497.0) than the ego vehicle (913.0).  Lateral separation is significant.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Given the different lanelets and trajectories, TTC is not a primary concern.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30623.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet (913.0) as the ego vehicle, but significantly behind.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary and behind the ego vehicle; no TTC risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30624.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (1842.0).  Lateral separation exists.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  While in a different lanelet, the proximity and movement of this vehicle warrants monitoring.  It poses a low risk currently.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30625.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a neighboring lanelet (912.0) and slightly behind the ego vehicle. Longitudinal distance is relatively small.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's higher speed and proximity warrant attention. A lane change by either vehicle could increase risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30626.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle is in a neighboring lanelet (912.0) and slightly behind the ego vehicle. It's closer than obstacle 30625.0.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Similar to obstacle 30625.0, but the closer proximity slightly increases the risk. Requires monitoring for potential lane changes.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


**- Obstacle ID: 30628.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet (913.0) as the ego vehicle and ahead. The longitudinal distance is relatively small.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving slower than the ego vehicle, creating a potential for a rear-end collision if the ego vehicle does not adjust its speed. Braking may be required soon.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
