Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.3 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario for potential collisions and safety risks.

Key Observations:
1. Ego vehicle is primarily in lanelet 913 during the scenario
2. Most relevant obstacles to track are:
- ID 30623: Stationary in lanelet 913
- ID 30628: Moving in lanelet 913
- ID 30626: Moving nearby but different lanelet

Detailed Analysis:

1. For Obstacle 30623:
- Distance Risk: High risk as it's in the same lanelet and stationary
- Distance safety score: 2 (High risk due to same lanelet occupancy)
- Time Risk: Medium risk as ego vehicle is moving slowly towards it
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High risk situation)

2. For Obstacle 30628:
- Distance Risk: Moderate as it's moving in same lanelet but maintaining distance
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk: Low as relative velocities are manageable
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium risk situation)

3. For Obstacle 30626:
- Distance Risk: Low as it's in different lanelet
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk: Low due to different trajectories
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low risk situation)

Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Key Findings:
1. No immediate collision risks (score 0) detected
2. No extreme risks (score 1) detected
3. Main concern is the stationary obstacle 30623 but maintaining safe distance
4. Ego vehicle's slow speed helps maintain safety margins
5. Different lanelet occupancy helps reduce collision risks with most obstacles

Recommendations:
1. Continue monitoring obstacle 30623 due to same lanelet occupancy
2. Maintain current speed profile as it provides good safety margins
3. No immediate evasive actions required
