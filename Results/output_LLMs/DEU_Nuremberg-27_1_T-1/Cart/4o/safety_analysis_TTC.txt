Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30622.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (497.0), far from ego vehicle’s lanelet (913.0). Relative positions suggest a significant lateral distance.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: No significant overlap in traveling paths or positions. The velocity of the obstacle is much higher and in a different direction.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30623.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned in the same lanelet (913.0) as the ego vehicle, yet the obstacle is stationary, creating a potential proximity risk.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3
- **Time Risk Reason**: With the obstacle stationary, TTC is indefinite but does not require urgent action due to ego’s low speed.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30624.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (1842.0) and located farther away, minimizing collision risk.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle is moving in a different directional path, reducing longitudinal collision prospects.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30625.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Located within a nearby but different lanelet (912.0), the lateral distance is close, which needs monitoring.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Given its higher speed, it might pose a future risk if trajectories shift, but current path doesn’t cross the ego’s path.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30626.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Within lanelet 912.0, close lateral proximity could be a factor if lane change occurs, but currently does not pose immediate risk.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Relative speed and direction indicate that a collision is not imminent.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30628.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Same lanelet (913.0) and very close in proximity to the ego vehicle. Potential for high collision risk exists due to overlap.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 2
- **Time Risk Reason**: Higher relative speed of opposing directions increases collision probability.
- **Time Safety Score**: 2
- **Overall Risk Score**: 2

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

In summary, none of the obstacles are in an immediate collision course (Overall Risk Score 0) or constitute an extreme risk (Overall Risk Score 1). The closest monitoring should pertain to obstacle 30628.0 due to its presence within the same lanelet, closely followed by stationary obstacles such as 30623.0. The situation is manageable but requires caution over the interval period.
