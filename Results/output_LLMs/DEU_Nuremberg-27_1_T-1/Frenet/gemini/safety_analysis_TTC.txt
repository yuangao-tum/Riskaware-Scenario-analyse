### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30622.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively far away (23.39m longitudinally and 53.66m laterally) and moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally, but the relative velocity is moderate. TTClong is >5s based on distance and velocity. Moving away laterally.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30623.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Moderately far longitudinally (16.71m) but directly in front (0m laterally).
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally with a moderate relative velocity. TTClong is approximately 4.84s based on distance and velocity. No lateral movement.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30624.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far away (27.92m longitudinally and 37.91m laterally) and moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally, but the relative velocity is moderate and distance is substantial. TTClong is approximately 3.34s based on distance and velocity.  Moving slightly away laterally.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30625.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Very close laterally (1.95m) and at the same longitudinal position (0m). High risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  High longitudinal closing velocity (-11.93 m/s). Though slightly moving away laterally, the longitudinal motion poses a significant risk. A collision is imminent.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30626.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Close longitudinally (10.03m) and laterally (1.83m).
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Very high longitudinal closing velocity (-11.84 m/s). While slightly moving away laterally, the longitudinal motion presents an extreme risk.  TTClong is approximately 0.85s, indicating a near-term collision risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30628.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Very close longitudinally (-0.18m suggests it might be slightly behind) and directly behind (0m laterally). Very high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away longitudinally based on velocity, however the acceleration suggests the vehicle is accelerating towards the ego vehicle from behind. This needs further monitoring but poses an immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 1
