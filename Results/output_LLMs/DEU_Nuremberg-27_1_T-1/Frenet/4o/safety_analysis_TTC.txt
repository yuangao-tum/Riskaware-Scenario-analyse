### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30622.0
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is at a diagonal distance (longitudinal 23.39 m, lateral 53.66 m) moving away laterally but towards the ego car longitudinally.
  - Distance safety score: 5 (long lateral distance reduces collision risk)
  - Time Risk reason: With a relative longitudinal velocity of -4.43 m/s, TTC is around 5.28 seconds, which is manageable given the distance.
  - Time safety score: 4 (adequate time to react)
  - Overall Risk score: 4 (low risk overall)

- Obstacle ID: 30623.0
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is directly in front at a close distance of 16.71 m with no lateral offset.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (somewhat close proximity)
  - Time Risk reason: With a relative longitudinal velocity of -3.45 m/s, TTC is approximately 4.84 seconds.
  - Time safety score: 3 (manageable but needs monitoring)
  - Overall Risk score: 3 (medium risk)

- Obstacle ID: 30624.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Positioned diagonally (longitudinal 27.92 m, lateral 37.91 m) with a higher longitudinal relative speed.
  - Distance safety score: 5 (substantial lateral distance reduces concern)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC with longitudinal speed -8.36 m/s is around 3.34 seconds.
  - Time safety score: 2 (higher speed means quicker collision, albeit not imminent)
  - Overall Risk score: 3 (medium risk)

- Obstacle ID: 30625.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Directly left, practically no longitudinal distance (0 m) with lateral distance 1.95 m, indicating a side-by-side presence.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (very close lateral proximity)
  - Time Risk reason: Same lane without closing velocity suggests little risk in motion.
  - Time safety score: 4 (steady relative positions and speeds)
  - Overall Risk score: 3 (medium risk, primarily due to lateral proximity)

- Obstacle ID: 30626.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Front-left close position (longitudinal 10.03 m, lateral 1.83 m), closing longitudinally.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (very close and closing)
  - Time Risk reason: Fast closing rate of -11.84 m/s results in TTC of about 0.85 seconds.
  - Time safety score: 1 (very immediate risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 1 (extreme risk due to very short TTC)

- Obstacle ID: 30628.0
  - Distance Risk reason: Behind but longitudinally overlapping (-0.18 m, lateral 0.0 m).
  - Distance safety score: 1 (overlapping indicates collision potential)
  - Time Risk reason: Positive relative speed implies separation will occur soon.
  - Time safety score: 5 (moving apart, though initially overlapping)
  - Overall Risk score: 2 (high risk due to proximity, though reducing)
