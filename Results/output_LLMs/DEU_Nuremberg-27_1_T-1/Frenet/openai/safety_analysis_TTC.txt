### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30622.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance is 23.39 m, and the lateral distance is 53.66 m. The obstacle is relatively far, with minimal collision risk from lateral movement since it's moving away laterally to the left.
   - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The longitudinal relative velocity is -4.43 m/s, which shows the obstacle is approaching. Time to collision (TTC) for longitudinal: \( \frac{23.39 \, m}{|-4.43 \, m/s|} \approx 5.28 \, s \). Since this is greater than 5 seconds, it indicates low risk in the time aspect. 
   - Time safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: **4**

2. **Obstacle ID: 30623.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 16.71 m, with no lateral distance. The obstacle is moving directly towards the ego vehicle, presenting a moderate collision risk.
   - Distance safety score: **3** (Medium Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC: \( \frac{16.71 \, m}{|-3.45 \, m/s|} \approx 4.85 \, s \). With TTC less than 5 seconds, there is a medium alignment risk in the time aspect.
   - Time safety score: **3** (Medium Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: **3**

3. **Obstacle ID: 30624.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 27.92 m, and lateral distance is 37.91m. The obstacle is moving away laterally, indicating a relatively safe position.
   - Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC: \( \frac{27.92 \, m}{|-8.36 \, m/s|} \approx 3.34 \, s \). The obstacle presents a medium risk of collision due to approaching speed.
   - Time safety score: **3** (Medium Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: **3**

4. **Obstacle ID: 30625.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is very close with a longitudinal distance of 0.0 m and a lateral distance of 1.95 m. It is effectively aligned with the ego vehicle, indicating significant risk.
   - Distance safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC is undefined due to direct alignment (0.0 m distance), thus it poses an immediate collision risk.
   - Time safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: **1**

5. **Obstacle ID: 30626.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance is 10.03 m and lateral distance is 1.83 m. The obstacle is approaching near the ego vehicle.
   - Distance safety score: **2** (High Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC: \( \frac{10.03 \, m}{|-11.84 \, m/s|} \approx 0.85 \, s \), indicating that an immediate response is required due to the short time until collision.
   - Time safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: **1**

6. **Obstacle ID: 30628.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of -0.18 m and laterally aligned. This suggests potential collision risk from behind.
   - Distance safety score: **3** (Medium Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal relative velocity is 2.68 m/s moving away; TTC is not calculable due to negative distance; hence, it indicates a notable risk for rear-end collision.
   - Time safety score: **2** (High Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: **2**

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30625.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

### Conclusion:
- Obstacle 30625.0 and 30626.0 present the highest risk, requiring urgent action to prevent potential collision.
- Other obstacles, while having varying levels of risk, do not present immediate collision situations, allowing for strategic driving maneuvers.
