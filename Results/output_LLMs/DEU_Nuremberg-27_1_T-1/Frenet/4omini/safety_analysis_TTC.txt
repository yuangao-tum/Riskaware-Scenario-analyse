### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30622.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance (23.39 m) is manageable, and the lateral distance (53.66 m) suggests it's quite far away. The obstacle moves away laterally and has a relative velocity that does not pose a significant immediate threat.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinally, the relative velocity of -4.43 m/s means the time to collision (TTC) is approximately 5.27 seconds, calculated as 23.39 m / 4.43 m/s. Lateral movement does not present an immediate risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)


- **Obstacle ID**: 30623.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 16.71 m, which is notable, and the lateral distance is 0.0 m, indicating a significant alignment which is concerning. 
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity longitudinally is -3.45 m/s, providing a TTC of approximately 4.84 seconds, calculated as 16.71 m / 3.45 m/s. The lack of lateral displacement also raises concern about the potential for collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

  
- **Obstacle ID**: 30624.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance (27.92 m) is reasonable, but the lateral distance (37.91 m) poses no immediate threat as the obstacle moves away laterally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: With a relative velocity of -8.36 m/s, the TTC is approximately 3.34 seconds (27.92 m / 8.36 m/s), which is manageable although it is approaching the vehicle.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

  
- **Obstacle ID**: 30625.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 0.0 m, indicating that the obstacle might physically collide with the ego vehicle if motion continues. The lateral distance (1.95 m) suggests a close proximity situation.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The longitudinal relative velocity of -11.93 m/s implies immediate danger, providing a TTC of negative or essentially no time to react. 
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

  
- **Obstacle ID**: 30626.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance (10.03 m) is relatively short, while the lateral distance (1.83 m) poses another proximity issue, indicating risks in direct alignment.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: With a relative velocity of -11.84 m/s, the exact situation could lead to a collision; the TTC value here is negative, suggesting an immediate danger.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

  
- **Obstacle ID**: 30628.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance of -0.18 m indicates the obstacle is directly behind the vehicle, while the lateral distance (0.0 m) states that they are quite close.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The positive relative velocity of 2.68 m/s suggests the obstacle is approaching quickly from behind, which raises concern about a potential collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30625.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

### Conclusion:
The analysis indicates that Obstacle 30625.0 poses a significant risk of collision with the ego vehicle due to its close longitudinal distance and high negative relative velocity. A few other obstacles also present concern, but their overall risk could still be managed with timely reactions.
