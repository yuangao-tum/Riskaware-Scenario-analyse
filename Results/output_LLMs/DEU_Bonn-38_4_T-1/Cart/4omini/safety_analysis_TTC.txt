Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.6 seconds):
To evaluate the collision risk in the provided scenario, we will identify obstacles that are either in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle or are on a potential trajectory that may lead to a collision. We will then calculate the Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) for each of them and assign risk scores based on provided criteria.

### Lanelet Context:

The Ego vehicle is in lanelet 353.0. The obstacles in the same lanelet are 30233.0, with the remainder in different lanelets.

### Calculations:

Given the ego vehicle's position and velocity, we will evaluate each obstacle.

1. **Obstacle 30233.0** (Lanelet 353.0):
   - **Position**: (-215.0806, 135.9026)
   - **Velocity**: 0.0 (stationary)
   - **MDC**: The X distance = |-210.712 - (-215.0806)| = 4.3686, Y distance = |134.2538 - 135.9026| = 1.6488. Using the Euclidean distance formula: 
     \( \text{MDC} = \sqrt{(4.3686^2 + 1.6488^2)} \approx 4.7\)
   - **TTC**: Since the obstacle is stationary (0 velocity), TTC is calculated based on ego velocity; 
     \( \text{TTC} = \frac{MDC}{\text{Ego Velocity}} = \frac{4.7}{4.2379} \approx 1.11 \) seconds.
   - **Risk Assessment**: 
     - Distance Safety Reason: The distance is quite close at ~4.7m, indicating a moderate risk.
     - Time Risk Reason: The TTC is about 1.11 seconds, indicating a potential collision in less than 2 seconds.
   - **Distance Score**: 3 (Medium)
   - **Time Score**: 2 (High)
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 2 (High)

All other obstacles have been filtered based on distance and lanelets (2 obstacles located in other lanelets were considered for evaluation but do not pose immediate risk due to being far off in both time and distance). 

### Summary Analysis:

No obstacles with an overall risk score of 0 (collision risk) or 1 (extreme risk) were identified in the assessed lanelets. The obstacle 30233.0 presents a high risk (score of 2).

### Summary in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

### Conclusion:

In this analysis, while there were no immediate collisions or extreme risks identified, caution is advised due to the presence of a stationary obstacle, which presents a high risk due to its proximity and the ego vehicle's momentum. Proper navigational strategies should be employed to ensure safe passage.
