Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.6 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30227.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle is positioned at (-220.1235, 149.4505), which is not in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and has a considerable distance primarily due to its lateral positioning. The obstacle's lack of velocity also implies it is stationary.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Since the obstacle has 0 velocity and there is a large distance both laterally and longitudinally, the Time to Collision is effectively infinite.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30228.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is quite close at (-214.0062, 139.0221) and shares lanelet 354.0 with the ego vehicle, raising moderate concerns regarding lateral distance.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3
- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle is stationary and very close in distance, but there is time to respond given the ego vehicle's negative acceleration.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30229.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle, at (-216.4114, 156.0102), is not in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and maintains a safe distance both longitudinally and laterally.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: With very low velocity and adequate separation in terms of distance, time risk remains low.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30230.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Located further away at (-212.6804, 162.8375) with minor longitudinal and lateral interest, this poses little immediate threat.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Again, with low relative velocity, significant time remains to make adjustments if needed.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30231.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: With a location at (-199.7282, 188.0354) and high velocity, it is moving faster but at a safe distance initially situated far away.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle's high velocity suggests a need for caution; however, its time to collision is not immediate due to significant starting distance.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30232.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: At a location of (-204.7496, 136.2519) and similar lanelet 354.0, there's proximity with limited distance longitudinally and laterally.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3
- **Time Risk Reason**: Due to being in the same lanelet and close proximity, quick reactions are needed, but speed differences suggest it is manageable.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30233.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: In very close proximity at (-215.0806, 135.9026), sharing lanelet 353.0, poses high lateral collision risk.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 2
- **Time Risk Reason**: Stationary object increases the immediate collision risk; despite stationary nature, quick maneuvers are essential.
- **Time Safety Score**: 2
- **Overall Risk Score**: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 30235.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned at (-188.7983, 131.1581), with considerable lateral distance ensures less immediate threat.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Despite having reasonable velocity, the starting separation offers sufficient time.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30236.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Far away at (-173.0385, 127.5472) in contrasting lanelet 354.0, maintaining significant distance laterally and longitudinally.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: We'll allow time to strategize using its existing velocity as it approaches but starts at a farther place.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4
