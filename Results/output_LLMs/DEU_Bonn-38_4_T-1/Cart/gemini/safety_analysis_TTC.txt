Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.6 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since precise trajectories aren't given,  I'll make estimations based on current positions, orientations, velocities, and accelerations.  A more robust analysis would involve predicted trajectories.
* "Longitudinal" refers to the direction of the ego vehicle's travel within its lanelet. "Lateral" refers to the perpendicular direction.
* I'll use a simplified collision check based on bounding boxes.  A more sophisticated analysis would use more precise vehicle shapes.
*  I am making the assumption that lanelet 353 and 354 are likely adjacent or overlapping based on the ego vehicle and other obstacles present in those lanelets.


**Calculations and Reasoning (Example using obstacle 30233):**

* **Obstacle ID: 30233**
* Obstacle 30233 is in the same lanelet (353) as the ego vehicle. This raises an immediate concern.
* The relative positions suggest it is close behind and slightly to the side.
* It's stationary (velocity and acceleration are zero), while the ego is moving forward with a negative acceleration. This suggests the ego vehicle is braking but could still collide with the stationary vehicle.
* Given the proximity and ego's negative acceleration, and the possibility that the ego is braking to avoid this very obstacle, there is a high risk of collision.

**Detailed Obstacle Analysis:**

* **Obstacle ID: 30227**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet (382), lateral distance seems significant.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason:  Not on a direct collision course.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4
* **Obstacle ID: 30228**
    - Distance Risk reason: In adjacent/overlapping lanelet (354), relatively close.
    - Distance safety score: 3
    - Time Risk reason: Stationary, but ego vehicle's path might lead to a collision depending on its future lateral movements.
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3
* **Obstacle ID: 30229**
    - Distance Risk reason: Different lanelet (382), but lateral distance is not substantial. Slow-moving.
    - Distance safety score: 3
    - Time Risk reason: Low speed and not directly in the path.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 3
* **Obstacle ID: 30230**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Different lanelet (1514), but proximity warrants monitoring. Slow-moving.
    - Distance safety score: 3
    - Time Risk reason:  Low speed and not on a direct collision path, thus lower risk over time.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 3
* **Obstacle ID: 30231**
    - Distance Risk reason: Different lanelet (351) and moving faster than ego, but proximity needs attention.
    - Distance safety score: 3
    - Time Risk reason:  Moving faster might decrease the risk if its trajectory diverges.
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3
* **Obstacle ID: 30232**
    - Distance Risk reason: Adjacent/overlapping lanelet (354) and close.
    - Distance safety score: 2
    - Time Risk reason: Moving slower than ego, but still a potential conflict point depending on trajectories.
    - Time safety score: 2
    - Overall Risk score: 2
* **Obstacle ID: 30233**
    - Distance Risk reason: Same lanelet (353), very close, stationary.
    - Distance safety score: 1
    - Time Risk reason: High risk of rear-ending due to being stationary in the same lane.
    - Time safety score: 1
    - Overall Risk score: 1
* **Obstacle ID: 30235**
    - Distance Risk reason: Adjacent/overlapping lanelet (354), but safe distance.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason:  Moving faster than ego, might not pose a threat unless paths converge significantly.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4
* **Obstacle ID: 30236**
    - Distance Risk reason: Adjacent/overlapping lanelet (354), further away than 30235.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason:  Moving faster and further away, reducing the time-related risk.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4
