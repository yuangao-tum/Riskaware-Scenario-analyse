### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30227.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance (9.1 m) is relatively safe, but the lateral distance (-9.98 m) indicates a presence coming from the front-right. This discrepancy adds some risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal time to collision (TTC) = 9.1 m / 4.24 m/s = 2.14 s. No significant risk of collision directly at this moment.
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30228.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance (0.09 m) is extremely close, while the lateral distance (-1.92 m) places it directly on course. This results in an immediate concern for a collision.
  - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** TTC = 0.09 m / 4.24 m/s = ~0.021 s, indicating an imminent collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1

- **Obstacle ID:** 30229.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance (7.58 m) is manageable, but the lateral distance (-17.36 m) poses potential lateral collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** TTC = 7.58 m / 4.23 m/s = 1.79 s, which allows time to react, but the lateral concern remains.
  - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 30230.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance (6.11 m) is relatively safe, while the lateral distance (-25.0 m) mostly negates direct risk of collision.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** TTC = 6.11 m / 4.19 m/s = 1.46 s, thus some reaction time.
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30231.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance (1.49 m) raises an alert, and the lateral distance (-52.95 m) suggests potential lateral intervention. Immediate proximity makes it risky.
  - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** TTC = 1.49 m / 2.96 m/s = 0.50 s, indicating a need for quick action.
  - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2

- **Obstacle ID:** 30232.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance (-0.56 m) closes in on the ego vehicle, with -2.12 m in lateral distance heightening concern. Transitory movement suggests increased risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** TTC = |-0.56| m / 2.26 m/s = ~0.25 s, which indicates an urgent issue.
  - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2

- **Obstacle ID:** 30233.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal (0.16 m) and lateral (0.0 m) distances correlate to an exceedingly high risk, with both dimensions indicating potential direct impact.
  - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** TTC = 0.16 m / 4.24 m/s = ~0.038 s, confirming an urgent collision danger.
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1

- **Obstacle ID:** 30235.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** With -17.3 m longitudinally, the ego car is moving away, which reduces risk, though the lateral (-2.15 m) places the vehicle within range. 
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** A safe distance indicates very little risk for imminent collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30236.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal (-33.41 m) shows a clear retreat, while the lateral (-3.53 m) still poses moderate concern, though primarily itâ€™s interplaying with distance moving away.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** No immediate risk is established based on the significant distance.
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4
