### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID**: 30227.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of 9.1 m and lateral distance of -9.98 m indicates that the obstacle is relatively far in the front-right, but the longitudinal approach is concerning.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The longitudinal relative velocity is -4.24 m/s, which translates to a TTC of approximately 2.14 seconds (9.1 m / 4.24 m/s). This indicates a medium risk of collision approaching.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 

2. **Obstacle ID**: 30228.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: With a longitudinal distance of 0.09 m and lateral distance of -1.92 m, this obstacle is extremely close to the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The longitudinal velocity is -4.24 m/s, yielding a TTC of approximately 0.02 seconds (0.09 m / 4.24 m/s), indicating imminent collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1 

3. **Obstacle ID**: 30229.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of 7.58 m and lateral distance of -17.36 m suggests a moderate distance, but it is moving towards the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The longitudinal velocity is -4.23 m/s, providing TTC of approximately 1.79 seconds (7.58 m / 4.23 m/s), indicating manageable risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 

4. **Obstacle ID**: 30230.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Distances of 6.11 m longitudinally and -25.0 m laterally also indicate that it is far enough to not cause immediate concern.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal velocity is -4.19 m/s, yielding a TTC of approximately 1.46 seconds (6.11 m / 4.19 m/s), showing some risk of collision but manageable.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 

5. **Obstacle ID**: 30231.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Distance of 1.49 m longitudinally and lateral distance of -52.95 m shows a critical situation as it is extremely close.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal relative velocity is -2.96 m/s, leading to a TTC of about 0.50 seconds (1.49 m / 2.96 m/s). This collision is likely unless acted on quickly.
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2 

6. **Obstacle ID**: 30232.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinally, the obstacle is at -0.56 m and laterally at -2.12 m, indicating proximity but moving away longitudinally offers some relief.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal motion is away at -2.26 m/s, creating no imminent collision risk (increasing distance) with negative TTC.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 

7. **Obstacle ID**: 30233.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Close proximity with only 0.16 m longitudinally and 0.0 m laterally suggests an immediate potential collision.
   - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC of approximately 0.04 seconds (0.16 m / 4.24 m/s), necessitating immediate reaction to avoid impact.
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1 

8. **Obstacle ID**: 30235.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is -17.3 m coupled with -2.15 m laterally indicates that it is too far from the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity of 1.84 m/s indicates no collision risk with no critical TTC approaching.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 

9. **Obstacle ID**: 30236.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of -33.41 m and lateral of -3.53 m shows it is far from the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative motion shows no risk, with a TTC that is positive and not concerning.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 

### Summary in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30228.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

In summary, there are no obstacles with a complete collision risk, but two (30228.0 and 30233.0) present extreme collision risk and should be addressed immediately.
