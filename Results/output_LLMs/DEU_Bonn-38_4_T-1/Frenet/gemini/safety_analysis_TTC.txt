### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30227.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively close longitudinally (9.1m) and laterally (-9.98m) in the front-right.  
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (-4.24 m/s) with negative relative acceleration. Lateral movement is negligible.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 30228.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close longitudinally (0.09m) and laterally (-1.92m) in the front-right.  Essentially an imminent collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -4.24 m/s.  
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 30229.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close longitudinally (7.58m) and laterally (-17.36m) in front-right.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching both longitudinally and laterally.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 30230.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively close longitudinally (6.11m) and laterally (-25.0m) in front-right.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching both longitudinally and laterally.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 30231.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Close longitudinally (1.49m) but relatively far laterally (-52.95m) in front-right. The longitudinal proximity poses the primary risk.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally, lateral movement is significant but the large lateral distance mitigates immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 30232.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Very close longitudinally (-0.56m) and laterally (-2.12m) in the rear-right. While slightly behind, the close proximity is concerning.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, but slight lateral movement towards ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 30233.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close longitudinally (0.16m) and directly in front (0.0m lateral). Imminent collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -4.24 m/s.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 30235.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far longitudinally (-17.3m) and laterally (-2.15m) in the rear-right.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching from behind, but the distance provides sufficient time. Lateral movement is minimal.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


**- Obstacle ID: 30236.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Far longitudinally (-33.41m) and laterally (-3.53m) in the rear-right.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although approaching from behind, the significant distance mitigates the risk. Lateral movement is minimal.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
