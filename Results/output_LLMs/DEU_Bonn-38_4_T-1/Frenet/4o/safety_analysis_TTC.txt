### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30227.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Longitudinal distance is 9.1 m and obstacle is moving towards the ego car.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Moderate risk due to reducing distance)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Longitudinal relative velocity indicates the obstacle is closing in at 4.24 m/s. TTC = 9.1 / 4.24 ≈ 2.15 seconds.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3 (Medium risk due to short TTC)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30228.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Very close longitudinal distance of 0.09 m. Highest proximity on all readings.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 1 (Extreme risk due to immediate proximity)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Immediate longitudinal proximity; TTC ≈ 0.09 / 4.24 ≈ 0.02 seconds.
- **Time Safety Score**: 1 (Extreme risk due to very short TTC)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 1

#### Obstacle ID: 30229.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Longitudinal distance is 7.58 m with lateral motion toward ego car.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Medium risk due to moderate closing distance)
- **Time Risk Reason**: TTC ≈ 7.58 / 4.23 ≈ 1.79 seconds.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3 (Moderate risk due to fair TTC time)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30230.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Longitudinal distance is 6.11 m, also closing in from the right.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Medium risk due to significant reducing distance)
- **Time Risk Reason**: TTC ≈ 6.11 / 4.19 ≈ 1.46 seconds.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3 (Medium risk due to adequate reaction time)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30231.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Short distance longitudinally at 1.49 m, with lateral movement towards ego vehicle.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 2 (High risk from the proximity and lateral movement)
- **Time Risk Reason**: TTC ≈ 1.49 / 2.96 ≈ 0.5 seconds.
- **Time Safety Score**: 2 (High risk with limited time to react)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 30232.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Rear distance of -0.56 m and moving away longitudinally but lateral motion towards the ego vehicle.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 2 (High risk due to backward movement coupled with lateral closing)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Negligible since it's moving away longitudinally.
- **Time Safety Score**: 2 (High risk with lateral compromise)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 30233.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Extreme closeness at longitudinal distance of 0.16 m.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 1 (Extreme risk due to very short distance)
- **Time Risk Reason**: TTC ≈ 0.16 / 4.24 ≈ 0.04 seconds.
- **Time Safety Score**: 1 (Immediate risk given TTC)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 1

#### Obstacle ID: 30235.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Rear distance of -17.3 m but approaching longitudinally and laterally.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Moderate risk given safe distance yet closing)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Longer TTC provides reaction time.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4 (Low risk provided the relative velocity)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30236.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Relative safe distance at -33.41 m, but moving closer.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low risk with considerable distance)
- **Time Risk Reason**: TTC is sufficient; lateral closing provides typical time for evasive action.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4 (Low risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4
