Safety analysis for the last timestep (7.0 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario for potential collisions, focusing on obstacles in the ego vehicle's path (lanelet 1963).

Key observations from the data:
1. Ego vehicle is in lanelet 1963 moving at varying speeds (around 7 m/s)
2. Multiple obstacles are in the same lanelet (1963)

Detailed Analysis:

1. Obstacle 20028 (in lanelet 1963):
- Distance Risk: Medium (Score: 3)
  Reason: Maintains safe distance ~10m ahead
- Time Risk: Low (Score: 4)
  Reason: Moving in same direction with lower speed
- Overall Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)

2. Obstacle 20029 (in lanelet 1963):
- Distance Risk: Medium (Score: 3)
  Reason: ~19m ahead, following similar path
- Time Risk: Low (Score: 4)
  Reason: Low relative velocity
- Overall Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)

3. Obstacle 20033 (in lanelet 1963):
- Distance Risk: Medium (Score: 3)
  Reason: ~41m ahead, following path
- Time Risk: Medium (Score: 3)
  Reason: Moderate relative velocity
- Overall Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk)

4. Obstacle 20036 (in lanelet 1963):
- Distance Risk: High (Score: 2)
  Reason: ~73m ahead but converging paths
- Time Risk: Medium (Score: 3)
  Reason: Higher relative velocity
- Overall Risk Score: 2 (High Risk)

5. Obstacle 20038 (in lanelet 1963):
- Distance Risk: Medium (Score: 3)
  Reason: ~91m ahead, stable trajectory
- Time Risk: Low (Score: 4)
  Reason: Safe relative velocity
- Overall Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)

JSON Summary:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

No obstacles present immediate collision risk (score 0) or extreme risk (score 1). The closest attention should be paid to Obstacle 20036 which has the highest risk score (2) due to its converging path with the ego vehicle, but it still maintains a safe distance and manageable relative velocity.

Key Safety Concerns:
1. Multiple vehicles in the same lanelet require continuous monitoring
2. Varying speeds of obstacles need attention
3. Converging paths with some obstacles warrant caution

Recommendations:
1. Maintain current speed and trajectory
2. Monitor Obstacle 20036 closely
3. Keep safe following distance from obstacles ahead
