Safety analysis for the last timestep (7.0 seconds):
To analyze the provided scenario for potential collisions, let’s follow the steps outlined: identifying obstacles in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, calculating the Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC), and assigning safety scores according to the defined risk levels.

### Step 1: Identify Relevant Obstacles
The ego vehicle is located in lanelet 1963. Considering the positions of the obstacles, the relevant obstacles in lanelet 1963 are:

- Obstacle 20028: (1.2392, -10.7391)
- Obstacle 20029: (0.7233, -18.9908)
- Obstacle 20030: (0.3494, -26.1673)
- Obstacle 20032: (-0.0025, -33.1993)
- Obstacle 20033: (-0.4341, -41.8229)
- Obstacle 20036: (-1.0258, -73.8215)
- Obstacle 20041: (22.549, -103.2478)
- Obstacle 20043: (34.9768, -112.4635)
- Obstacle 20045: (45.1067, -119.9751)

### Step 2: Calculate TTC and MDC for each obstacle
To calculate the distances and times until collision, we will compute:
1. **MDC**: Minimum distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle.
2. **TTC**: Time until possible collision considering ego's braking.

**Formulas**:
- Distance = sqrt((X2 - X1)² + (Y2 - Y1)²)
- TTC = Distance / Closing Speed
- For braking effects: Closing speed = (Ego Speed - Obstacle Speed)

### Obstacle Analysis

### Obstacle 20028
- Position: (1.2392, -10.7391)
- MDC: `D = sqrt((1.2392 - (-0.4308))² + (-10.7391 - (-69.4435))²) = sqrt((1.6700)² + (58.7044)²) = sqrt(2.784 + 3448.302) ≈ 58.757`
- TTC: `TTC = 58.757 / (6.8645 - 1.3243) ≈ 10.48 seconds`
- Risk: Low (4) for distance, Low (4) for time

### Obstacle 20029
- Position: (0.7233, -18.9908)
- MDC: `D = sqrt((0.7233 - (-0.4308))² + (-18.9908 - (-69.4435))²) = sqrt((1.1541)² + (50.4527)²) ≈ 50.973`
- TTC: `TTC = 50.973 / (6.8645 - 0.309) ≈ 7.76 seconds`
- Risk: Low (4) for distance, Low (4) for time

### Obstacle 20030
- Position: (0.3494, -26.1673)
- MDC: `D ≈ 43.244`
- TTC: `TTC ≈ 6.12 seconds`
- Risk: Low (4) for distance, Low (4) for time

### Obstacle 20032
- Position: (-0.0025, -33.1993)
- MDC: `D ≈ 36.614`
- TTC: `TTC ≈ 5.32 seconds`
- Risk: Low (4) for distance, Low (4) for time

### Obstacle 20033
- Position: (-0.4341, -41.8229)
- MDC: `D ≈ 28.694`
- TTC: `TTC ≈ 4.31 seconds`
- Risk: Low (4) for distance, Low (4) for time

### Obstacle 20036
- Position: (-1.0258, -73.8215)
- MDC: `D ≈ 5.212`
- TTC: `TTC ≈ 0.13 seconds`
- Risk: Negligible (5) for distance, Extreme (1) for time

### Obstacle 20041
- Position: (22.549, -103.2478)
- MDC: `D ≈ 127.939`
- TTC: `TTC ≈ 18.78 seconds`
- Risk: Negligible (5) for distance, Low (4) for time

### Obstacle 20043
- Position: (34.9768, -112.4635)
- MDC: `D ≈ 146.077`
- TTC: `TTC ≈ 21.10 seconds`
- Risk: Negligible (5) for distance, Low (4) for time

### Obstacle 20045
- Position: (45.1067, -119.9751)
- MDC: `D ≈ 169.046`
- TTC: `TTC ≈ 25.36 seconds`
- Risk: Negligible (5) for distance, Low (4) for time

### Summary of Risk Scores and Final Evaluation
The following safety scores are assigned:
- Obstacle 20028: Overall Risk score 4
- Obstacle 20029: Overall Risk score 4
- Obstacle 20030: Overall Risk score 4
- Obstacle 20032: Overall Risk score 4
- Obstacle 20033: Overall Risk score 4
- Obstacle 20036: Overall Risk score 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Obstacle 20041: Overall Risk score 4
- Obstacle 20043: Overall Risk score 4
- Obstacle 20045: Overall Risk score 4

### Safety analysis for timestep 7.0: 
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20036",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
```

### Conclusion:
There are no obstacles with a risk score of 0 (collision risk), but there is one obstacle (20036) with extreme risk (score of 1), which indicates an immediate risk of collision requiring urgent attention. All other relevant obstacles have a risk score of 4, indicating low risk.
