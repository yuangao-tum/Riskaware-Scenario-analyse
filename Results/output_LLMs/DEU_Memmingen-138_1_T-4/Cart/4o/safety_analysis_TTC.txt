Safety analysis for the last timestep (7.0 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 7.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 20025.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and is stationary. Relative distance ensures negligible interference.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: As the velocity is zero, there is no convergence between the ego and the obstacle.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20027.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and at a significant distance.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Minimal velocity and acceleration, no risk of collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20028.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is ahead in the same lanelet, possibly leading to decreased space eventually; consideration due to small velocity difference.

- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20038.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned far and moving at a considerable speed, not in immediate path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Moving laterally away, negating any collision likelihood.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20039.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Different lanelet moving quickly, but not on intercept path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: High velocity lateral displacement inhibits collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20040.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary at a significant distance and different trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Absence of movement negates time-based risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20041.0

- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Moving away laterally with no threat trajectory.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20042.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Extreme lateral distance implies no collision risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
