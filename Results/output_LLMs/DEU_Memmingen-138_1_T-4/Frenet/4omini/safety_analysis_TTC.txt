### Safety analysis for timestep 7.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 20025.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance is longitudinally 66.35 m, which provides a reasonable space to the obstacle. The lateral distance is 0.0 m, indicating that it's directly ahead. 
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative longitudinal velocity is -6.86 m/s. TTC = 66.35 / 6.86 = 9.66 seconds, which indicates a manageable situation.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

2. **Obstacle ID: 20027.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of 65.11 m and lateral distance of -4.22 m, placing the obstacle in the front-right zone.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal velocity is -6.73 m/s. TTC = 65.11 / 6.73 = 9.66 seconds, indicating adequate reaction time.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 20028.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinally 53.93 m away, laterally -4.24 m, partially moving away to the right.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal velocity of -5.55 m/s gives TTC = 53.93 / 5.55 = 9.73 seconds.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

4. **Obstacle ID: 20029.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of 45.73 m and lateral of -3.14 m. Positioning in the front-right indicates a moderate concern but manageable distance.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal velocity of -6.56 m/s yields TTC = 45.73 / 6.56 = 6.98 seconds. Still, with 7 seconds until potential impact.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

5. **Obstacle ID: 20030.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: At a longitudinal distance of 38.6 m and a lateral distance of -2.25 m, still sufficient to maintain safety.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC = 38.6 / 6.86 = 5.63 seconds, providing a solid buffer.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

6. **Obstacle ID: 20036.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is at a distance of 0.0 m longitudinally and laterally; means it's in collision range.
   - **Distance safety score**: 0 (Collision Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: With a relative longitudinal velocity of 1.03 m/s and direct alignment, immediate action is required.
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 0

7. **Obstacle ID: 20039.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of 5.53 m and laterally 1.85 m. This places it very close but still a potential side impact situation.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal velocity is -20.15 m/s gives a very short TTC = 5.53 / 20.15 = 0.27 seconds, indicating urgency.
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1
