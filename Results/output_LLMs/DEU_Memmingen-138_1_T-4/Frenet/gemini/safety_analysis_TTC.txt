### Safety analysis for timestep 7.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**General Notes:**  Since precise ego vehicle motion isn't given, assumptions are made based on relative obstacle movements.  Lateral movement calculations are simplified, assuming constant lateral velocity when calculating TTClat (as lateral acceleration is not considered in this simplified model). A more sophisticated model incorporating lateral acceleration would improve accuracy. TTC is considered infinite if the relative velocity indicates moving away. MDC is considered not applicable if objects are moving away.
