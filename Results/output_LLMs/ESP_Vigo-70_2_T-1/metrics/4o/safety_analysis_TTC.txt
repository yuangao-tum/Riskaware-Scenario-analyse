```markdown
### Safety analysis for timestep 8.8 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3391
  - Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is moving away with DTClong = 39.39 and DTClat = 15.25, relative direction being rear-left.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
  - Time Risk Reason: TTC is infinite in both longitudinal and lateral directions, implying very low risk.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
