Safety analysis for timestep 8.8 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 8.8 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 3391  
- **Relative Direction:** Rear-left  
- **Distance Risk Reason:** The distance to collision is significant (Longitudinal: 39.39, Lateral: 15.25), creating a negligible risk for collision since both distances are well above the thresholds.  
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 5  
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 5  
- **Time Risk Reason:** Since both Longitudinal and Lateral TTC are infinite, there's no risk of collision, confirming negligible risk overall.  
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 5  
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 5  
- **Overall Risk Score:** 5  

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 3393  
- **Relative Direction:** Behind  
- **Distance Risk Reason:** The longitudinal distance to collision is very short (0.2) with exact lateral alignment (0.0). This indicates a high risk of immediate collision from behind.  
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 2  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 1  
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 2  
- **Time Risk Reason:** The longitudinal TTC is extremely short (0.04) with zero lateral risk, emphasizing an immediate collision scenario.  
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 1  
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 0  
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 1  
- **Overall Risk Score:** 1  

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 3394  
- **Relative Direction:** Rear-left

- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 4  
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 4  
- **Time Risk Reason:** Both TTC metrics are infinite, indicating complete safety in terms of timing.  
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 5  
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 5  
- **Overall Risk Score:** 4  

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 5  
- **Time Risk Reason:** Both TTC values are infinite, reinforcing the negligible risk scenario.  
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 5  
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 5  
- **Overall Risk Score:** 5  

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 3396  
- **Relative Direction:** Rear-left  
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Large longitudinal distances (45.89) paired with substantial lateral distances (19.0) indicate no immediate danger of collision.  
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 5  
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 5  
- **Time Risk Reason:** Longitudinal and lateral TTC values are infinite, ensuring no collision risk in timing as well.  
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 5  
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 5  
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 5  
- **Overall Risk Score:** 5
