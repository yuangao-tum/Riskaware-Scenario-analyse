### Safety analysis for timestep 8.8 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 3391.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is at a longitudinal distance of -39.39 m (which indicates behind the ego car) and a lateral distance of 15.25 m. It's moving away longitudinally. Therefore, there is no immediate risk of collision.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The obstacle moves away with a relative longitudinal velocity of -6.97 m/s, indicating that the distance is increasing; hence, there is no potential for collisions.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 3393.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is very close at a longitudinal distance of -0.2 m (almost at the back), which puts it in a precarious position, while the lateral distance is 0.0 m (exactly aligned). It is driving toward the ego car.
   - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal velocity of 4.61 m/s indicates that the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle quickly, leading to a likely collision unless immediate action is taken.
   - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 3394.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is at a longitudinal distance of -28.21 m and lateral distance of 2.66 m. The motion is away longitudinally and laterally to the left, indicating low immediate concern.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away with a longitudinal velocity of -3.88 m/s, contributing to an increasing separation.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 3395.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is at a longitudinal distance of -34.71 m and a lateral distance of 16.48 m. It is also moving away longitudinally and laterally to the left, indicating no imminent danger.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: With a relative velocity of -15.93 m/s longitudinally and moving away, this distance is increasing.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 3396.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is at a longitudinal distance of -45.89 m and 19.0 m laterally, moving away longitudinally and laterally approaching. Still, the distances are sufficient to mitigate immediate risk of collision.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity coefficient of -6.96 m/s longitudinally and no lateral relative motion suggests an increasing distance and no risk of collision.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format: 
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3393.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
