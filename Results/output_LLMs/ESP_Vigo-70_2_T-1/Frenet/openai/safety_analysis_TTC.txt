### Safety analysis for timestep 8.8 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 3391.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: With a longitudinal distance of -39.39 m and a lateral distance of 15.25 m, the obstacle is moving away, indicating that there is a reasonable amount of space.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal velocity is -6.97 m/s, indicating that the obstacle is receding. Given the substantial distance and decreasing speed, the collision likelihood is low.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4

2. **Obstacle ID: 3393.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: With a longitudinal distance of -0.2 m and a lateral distance of 0.0 m, the obstacle is very close and correctly aligned with the ego vehicle.
   - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal velocity is 4.61 m/s, indicating the obstacle is approaching quickly, regardless of the minimal distance already present.
   - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 1

3. **Obstacle ID: 3394.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance of -28.21 m and lateral distance of 2.66 m indicates a reasonable gap; however, the obstacle is within the path of the ego vehicle.
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: With a longitudinal relative velocity of -3.88 m/s, although the obstacle is moving away, the risk of eventually encountering it is moderate due to proximity.
   - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 3

4. **Obstacle ID: 3395.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance of -34.71 m and lateral distance of 16.48 m suggest a relative safety based on the current spacing away from the ego vehicle.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The relative velocity is -15.93 m/s longitudinally, suggesting it is distancing itself rapidly. The overall approach is minimal.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4

5. **Obstacle ID: 3396.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance of -45.89 m and lateral distance of 19.0 m indicate significant separation. Though it is gaining ground laterally, the separation distance is substantial.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: With longitudinal relative velocity at -6.96 m/s and no lateral movement towards the ego vehicle, the likelihood of collision remains minimal.
   - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4
