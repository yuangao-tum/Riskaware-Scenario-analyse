### Safety analysis for timestep 8.8 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3391.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Located rear-left, longitudinal distance is significant at -39.39 m with lateral distance of 15.25 m. Obstacle is moving away at 6.97 m/s longitudinally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Due to the negative relative velocity (indicating that the obstacle is moving away), TTC is not applicable.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3393.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Very close behind at -0.2 m, indicating it is almost overlapping or very close to the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity at 4.61 m/s towards the ego vehicle, which suggests an imminent collision if no action is taken. TTC would be very low.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3394.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned rear-left, with longitudinal distance of -28.21 m and lateral distance of 2.66 m, moving away from the ego vehicle laterally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Moving away in both longitudinal and lateral directions with sufficient speed, no immediate collision risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3395.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned rear-left with a longitudinal distance of -34.71 m and lateral distance of 16.48 m, moving rapidly away.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Fast moving away longitudinally and laterally, which reduces any collision risk significantly.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3396.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned rear-left at -45.89 m longitudinal and 19.0 m lateral, with obstacle moving longitudinally away.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: With negative relative velocity indicating movement away, collision risk is negligible.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
