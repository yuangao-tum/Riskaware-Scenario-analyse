Safety analysis for the last timestep (8.8 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 8.8 seconds: 

Here's the evaluation of each obstacle based on the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 3391**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance between Ego (-531.2179, 505.4682) and the obstacle (-518.3852, 550.7047) is approximately 49.721 meters in lateral direction. Given the ego's path, they are separated well enough that the current distance is safe. There is no lateral approach.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary (velocity = 0). Hence, the Time to Collision (TTC) is infinitely large given no movement towards each other.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (based on average of Distance and Time scores)

2. **Obstacle ID: 3393**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The ego is positioned at (-531.2179, 505.4682) and the obstacle at (-531.6455, 510.1605). They are in the same lanelet and relatively close together, indicating a low separation.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle with a velocity of 11.5798. Given the distance between them, the Time to Collision is calculated to be around 0.2 seconds, indicating an urgent collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (based on average of Distance and Time scores)

3. **Obstacle ID: 3394**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance between Ego and this obstacle is significantly larger, approximately 15 meters apart with no direct path of collision.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The approaching angle does not show any risk. The obstacle has a low velocity, so even if it approached, it would not be an immediate risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (based on average of Distance and Time scores)

4. **Obstacle ID: 3395**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance to this obstacle is about 36.0 meters. They are not aligned to collide based on their lanes.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving towards Ego; however, given the distance and speed, the TTC is estimated to be around 3.4 seconds, which gives enough time to maneuver.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (based on average of Distance and Time scores)

5. **Obstacle ID: 3396**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle in this case is also removed from the immediate path of Ego at a distance of roughly 52.0 meters laterally.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle has negligible motion. Therefore, there is no risk of collision as it wonâ€™t enter the path of Ego.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (based on average of Distance and Time scores)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3393",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

### Summary of Findings:
- There is **one obstacle at immediate collision risk** (Obstacle ID: 3393) requiring urgent attention.
- Other obstacles show various ranges of safety (mostly **low to high risk**) without immediate collision dangers, providing some time and space for decision maneuvers.
