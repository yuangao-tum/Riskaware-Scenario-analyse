Safety analysis for the last timestep (8.8 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario and evaluate collision risks:

### Safety Analysis:

1) For Obstacle 3391 (In lanelet 409):
- Distance Risk: Stationary obstacle far from ego vehicle's path
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk: No immediate time-based risk due to different lanelets
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

2) For Obstacle 3392 (In lanelet 408):
- Distance Risk: Different lanelet, maintaining safe distance
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk: Moving in different direction, no immediate risk
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

3) For Obstacle 3393 (Transitions between lanelets):
- Distance Risk: Shares lanelet 503 initially, then moves to different lanelets
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk: Moderate risk during lanelet transitions
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

4) For Obstacle 3394 (In lanelet 503):
- Distance Risk: Initially in same lanelet as ego, but maintaining safe distance
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk: Moving in same direction with safe spacing
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

5) For Obstacle 3395 (In lanelet 503/2254):
- Distance Risk: Shares lanelet periodically, but maintains safe distance
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk: No immediate collision risk due to speed differences
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

6) For Obstacle 3396 (In lanelet 409):
- Distance Risk: Different lanelet, very low speed
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk: No time-based risk due to position and speed
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### JSON Summary:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

No obstacles present immediate collision (score 0) or extreme risk (score 1) scenarios. The lowest risk score observed is 3, indicating moderate but manageable risk levels. The ego vehicle maintains safe distances and there are no imminent collision threats throughout the scenario.

The main points of attention are:
1. Obstacle 3393's lanelet transitions
2. Obstacle 3394's shared lanelet movement
3. Obstacle 3395's periodic lane sharing

However, all these situations maintain sufficient safety margins in both distance and time metrics.
