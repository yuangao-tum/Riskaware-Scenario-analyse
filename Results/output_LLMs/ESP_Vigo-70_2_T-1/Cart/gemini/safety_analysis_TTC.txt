Safety analysis for the last timestep (8.8 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 8.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3391.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (409) than the ego vehicle (406), and although moderately close laterally, poses no immediate longitudinal risk given the ego vehicle's forward motion.  Further calculations are needed to precisely determine lateral risk, but initial assessment suggests moderate risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Without precise trajectories and lateral speeds, TTC is difficult to calculate accurately. However, given the different lanelets and moderate lateral separation, TTC is likely moderate.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3393.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet (406) as the ego vehicle and very close longitudinally. The small longitudinal difference and similar headings suggest a high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Both vehicles are moving in a similar direction, but the obstacle is moving faster. The small longitudinal separation combined with the obstacle's higher speed suggests a very short TTC, indicating extreme risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 3394.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle is in a different lanelet (2254).  Its lateral position is close to the ego vehicle, indicating a potential lane change situation.  Further analysis of trajectories is required, but there's a moderate risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Without trajectory information, TTC is difficult to determine precisely.  Depending on the obstacle's intended lane change maneuver, TTC could range from low to high.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3395.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (408). Laterally, it's closer than obstacle 3391.0, suggesting a slightly higher lateral risk. More information is needed to fully assess the risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Similar to 3391.0, estimating TTC accurately requires more data. Given the different lanelets and the lateral proximity, TTC is likely moderate to high.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 3396.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (409) and further away laterally than 3391.0.  It presents less immediate risk than closer obstacles.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Given the larger lateral separation and different lanelet, the TTC is likely longer than for closer obstacles.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
