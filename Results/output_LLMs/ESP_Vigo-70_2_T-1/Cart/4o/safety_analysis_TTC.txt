Safety analysis for the last timestep (8.8 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 8.8: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 3391.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is located far ahead on a different lanelet (409.0), both in longitudinal and lateral directions relative to the Ego vehicle, with no movement (velocity = 0.0).
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: With a velocity of 0.0, there is no risk of collision over time.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3393.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is in the same lanelet (406.0) and is in proximity to the ego’s path both longitudinally and laterally, indicating potential collision risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 
- **Time Risk reason**: Since both are in the same lanelet with a close approach, the TTC values in both directions would likely indicate a moderate risk if speed differentials affect proximity.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 3394.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in a different lanelet (2254.0) but closer in lateral proximity. Although the lateral TTC is potentially low, the longitudinal offset may prevent direct interference.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Due to its relative trajectory and different lanelet, the likelihood of immediate collision over time is low.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 3395.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle, though in a different lanelet (408.0), is progressing at a significant speed and may close the lateral and longitudinal gap quickly.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Given the high speed and lanelet proximity, the time to affect a potential collision would be moderate.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 3396.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned further away in a separate lanelet (409.0), with virtually no movement (velocity = 0.007), minimizing risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Minuscule velocity suggests negligible risk over time regarding the possibility of entering the ego vehicle’s path.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5
