Safety analysis for the last timestep (0.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 0.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
#### Obstacle ID: 20073.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located relatively far with no motion, the position is not in direct path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Static, no TTC applicable, not in direct path of motion.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20075.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located far and stationary in a different lanelet, minimal interaction.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Static with no immediate threat, not along the moving direction.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20076.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in a separate lanelet with no motion; hence no immediate risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Static and maintaining distance, no direct impact expected.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20078.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary and situated far away from the current path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: No movement and distance maintained, negligible TTC concerns.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20081.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Far away, static, and located in a non-intersecting lanelet.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Static, with distance, managed under current motion direction.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20082.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Far from the current ego position with no intersecting vectors.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Static and remains in a distant position, no immediate collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20084.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary and positioned distantly, doesn't affect ego path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Static position, no movement affecting TTC.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20085.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary but relatively close, not on direct collision path.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Obstacle's position doesn't directly compromise TTC.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Summary in JSON Format:
Since no obstacles have an Overall Risk Score of 0 or 1, we return null for collision or extreme risk categories.

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

This assessment indicates that the scenario is fundamentally safe with all obstacles positioned at a safe distance or with no direct trajectory overlap with the ego vehicle, hence no immediate collision or extreme risk identified. Each obstacle's static nature or distant position contributes to a negligible risk profile.
