Safety analysis for the last timestep (0.7 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario for potential collisions:

### Safety Analysis:

1. Analyzing ego vehicle's trajectory (Lanelet 2039):
- Initial position: (28.9958, 103.068)
- Velocity decreasing from 12.8552 to 6.0293
- Orientation around -1.926 (moving south)

2. Key obstacles in the same lanelet (2039):
- Obstacle 20141 (22.5488, 85.7009):
  - Distance Risk reason: In same lanelet, ~15m ahead
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low risk due to sufficient gap)
  - Time Risk reason: Moving slower (1.4563 m/s) than ego
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low risk due to decreasing velocity)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle 20148 (25.0123, 92.3374):
  - Distance Risk reason: In same lanelet, ~10m ahead
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium risk due to moderate gap)
  - Time Risk reason: Velocity decreasing (7.7863 m/s)
  - Time safety score: 3 (Medium risk due to closing speed)
  - Overall Risk score: 3

3. Notable observations:
- Ego vehicle is decelerating significantly
- Most other obstacles are stationary or in different lanelets
- No imminent collision risks detected
- Sufficient spacing maintained with nearby vehicles

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Key findings:
1. The ego vehicle is maintaining safe distances from all obstacles
2. Deceleration helps reduce any potential risks
3. No obstacles present immediate collision or extreme risk
4. The closest obstacles (20141 and 20148) are being approached safely with adequate spacing and speed differential
5. The scenario shows proper safety margins are being maintained

The analysis indicates this is a relatively safe driving situation with no immediate collision risks or extreme hazards present. The ego vehicle's decreasing speed provides additional safety margin.
