Safety analysis for the last timestep (0.7 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 0.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since precise dimensions of the ego vehicle and obstacles are missing,  I'm assuming a simplified circular safety bubble around each entity for collision detection.  A more accurate analysis would require vehicle dimensions and shapes.
* Lateral distance calculations consider the lanelet information.  Obstacles in different lanelets, even if close, might not pose an immediate threat if lane changes are not imminent.
* I'm assuming a constant velocity model for TTC calculations. A more refined analysis would involve using acceleration information for prediction.
* The provided orientation values appear to be radians.
* "DTClong" and "DTClat" are interpreted as longitudinal and lateral distance to collision. I calculate these based on the given positions and orientations.
* The given velocity and acceleration information for the ego-vehicle and obstacle 20141, 20144, 20145, 20147, 20148, 20150, 20155, 20157, 20158, 20159, 20160, 20161, 20162, 20163 are essential for risk assessment and used for calculating the TTC.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**Methodology:**

1. **Distance Risk:** Calculated using Euclidean distance between ego and obstacle. A threshold is used to categorize risk.  Since no specific threshold is provided, I'll use approximate values based on general safe following distances (e.g., 2-3 seconds rule converted to distance using ego vehicle's speed).

2. **Time Risk:** Calculated using TTC, derived from relative velocity and distance. TTC values below a threshold (e.g., 2-3 seconds) signify higher risk.

3. **Overall Risk:** A weighted combination of distance and time risk, with TTC playing a dominant role in near-collision situations.
