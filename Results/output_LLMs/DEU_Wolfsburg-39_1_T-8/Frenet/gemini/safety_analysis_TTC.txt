### Safety analysis for timestep 0.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

The provided data shows relative longitudinal velocity and acceleration are negative for most obstacles, indicating they are moving towards the ego vehicle.  We'll analyze each based on TTC and MDC, approximating TTC with a simplified calculation (distance/relative velocity) since constant acceleration isn't guaranteed.  This approximation is sufficient for a quick risk assessment.  A negative TTC indicates the objects are moving away from each other. A TTC close to 0 signifies immediate danger.


- **Obstacle ID: 20073.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Directly in front, 80.65m longitudinal distance.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching quickly, relative longitudinal velocity -6.03 m/s.  Approximate TTC = 80.65/6.03 ≈ 13.37s. This appears safe for now but needs monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 20075.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Front-left, reasonable distance (109.52m longitudinal, 15.46m lateral).
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching longitudinally (-6.03 m/s).  Approximate TTC ≈ 18.16s.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20076.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Front-left, safe distance (93.16m longitudinal, 29.01m lateral).
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching longitudinally (-6.03 m/s). Approximate TTC ≈ 15.45s.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
