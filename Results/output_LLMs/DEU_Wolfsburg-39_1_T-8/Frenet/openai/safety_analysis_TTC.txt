### Safety analysis for timestep 0.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID:** 20073.0
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The distance longitudinally is 80.65 m and laterally 0.0 m, indicating a very close proximity with no lateral buffer.
   - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** TTC is calculated as the distance divided by the relative velocity. With a relative velocity of -6.03 m/s, TTC = 80.65 / 6.03 = 13.38 seconds. The safe time to collision indicates manageable risk.
   - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 2

2. **Obstacle ID:** 20075.0
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The distance is 109.52 m longitudinally and 15.46 m laterally, providing a reasonable buffer.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** TTC = 109.52 / 6.03 = 18.19 seconds, indicating ample time to react.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4

3. **Obstacle ID:** 20076.0
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinally 93.16 m, laterally 29.01 m—good safety margins.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** TTC = 93.16 / 6.03 = 15.43 seconds, indicating enough reaction time.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4

4. **Obstacle ID:** 20078.0
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Successfully maintains a distance of 109.43 m longitudinally and 11.97 m laterally.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** TTC = 109.43 / 6.03 = 18.16 seconds—ample reaction time.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4

5. **Obstacle ID:** 20081.0
   - **Distance Risk reason:** 116.27 m longitudinally, 11.79 m laterally confirms sufficient distance.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** TTC = 116.27 / 6.03 = 19.29 seconds, providing very manageable risk.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4

6. **Obstacle ID:** 20088.0
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal 67.94 m and laterally 0.0 m—minimal space.
   - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** TTC = 67.94 / 6.03 = 11.25 seconds, suggesting moderate risk given proximity.
   - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 3

7. **Obstacle ID:** 20141.0
   - **Distance Risk reason:** At 6.86 m longitudinally, this indicates an immediate danger.
   - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** TTC = 6.86 / 4.57 = 1.50 seconds—a very high risk of collision.
   - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 1

8. **Obstacle ID:** 20148.0
   - **Distance Risk reason:** It is at the collision point with 0.0 m in both dimensions.
   - **Distance safety score:** 0 (Collision)
   - **Time Risk reason:** As 0.0 m is equivalent to a certain collision condition, TTC is not applicable.
   - **Time safety score:** 0 (Collision)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 0
