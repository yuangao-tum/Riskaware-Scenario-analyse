### Safety analysis for timestep 0.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 20073.0**  
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is 80.65 m ahead in the same lane. Considering a relative velocity of -6.03 m/s, the risk of collision based on distance is low.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4  
  - **Time Risk reason:** With a relative speed of -6.03 m/s, the Time to Collision (TTC) can be estimated as 13.38 seconds (80.65 m / 6.03 m/s). This allows ample time to react and maneuver.
  - **Time safety score:** 4  
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4  

- **Obstacle ID: 20075.0**  
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is at 109.52 m longitudinally and 15.46 m laterally; being front-left reduces the immediate risk of a collision.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5  
  - **Time Risk reason:** Given the relative longitudinal velocity of -6.03 m/s, TTC is approximately 18.16 seconds, providing a substantial time buffer.
  - **Time safety score:** 5  
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5  

- **Obstacle ID: 20076.0**  
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Located 93.16 m ahead and 29.01 m to the left, the risk is low given its lateral positioning.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5  
  - **Time Risk reason:** Relative velocity puts TTC at 15.45 seconds, allowing sufficient time to react.
  - **Time safety score:** 5  
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5  

- **Obstacle ID: 20078.0**  
  - **Distance Risk reason:** With a distance of 109.43 m and lateral offset of 11.97 m, the risk is minimal.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5  
  - **Time Risk reason:** TTC calculation yields 18.15 seconds, indicating very low urgency.
  - **Time safety score:** 5  
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5  

- **Obstacle ID: 20141.0**  
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is extremely close at 6.86 m in front, necessitating immediate attention.
  - **Distance safety score:** 1  
  - **Time Risk reason:** Short distance and a closing speed of -4.57 m/s result in a TTC of roughly 1.5 seconds.
  - **Time safety score:** 1  
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1  

- **Obstacle ID: 20148.0**  
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is in contact with the ego vehicle, representing an immediate collision scenario.
  - **Distance safety score:** 0  
  - **Time Risk reason:** A stationary scenario relative to the ego vehicle implies collision has occurred.
  - **Time safety score:** 0  
  - **Overall Risk score:** 0  

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20148.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20141.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
```

This evaluation concludes that obstacle 20073.0 through 20140.0 have low or negligible risks due to their safe distances and TTC values. Obstacle 20148.0 has an overall risk score of 0 indicating a collision, and obstacle 20141.0 presents an extreme risk with an overall score of 1.
