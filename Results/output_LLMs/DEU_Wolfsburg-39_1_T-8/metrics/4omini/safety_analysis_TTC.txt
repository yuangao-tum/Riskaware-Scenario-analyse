Safety analysis for timestep 0.7 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 0.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20048
- Relative Direction: Collision
- Distance Risk Reason: Collision detected with both longitudinal and lateral distances equal to zero.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 0
- Time Risk Reason: Collision detected with both longitudinal and lateral times equal to zero.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Risk Score: 0

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20141
- Relative Direction: Front
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance (6.86) is very close and lateral distance (0.0) indicates exact alignment, hence a very high risk of collision.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.5
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal time (1.5) is critical and lateral time (0.0) indicates immediate risk of collision.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 0.5
- Overall Risk Score: 0.5

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20137
- Relative Direction: Front
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance (13.69) is close and lateral distance (0.0) indicates exact alignment, hence a high risk of collision.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.5
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal time (2.27) is critical and lateral time (0.0) indicates immediate risk of collision.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 0.5
- Overall Risk Score: 0.5

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20121
- Relative Direction: Front
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance (31.74) is manageable and lateral distance (0.0) indicates exact alignment, hence a moderate risk of collision.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 3  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.5
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal time (5.26) is acceptable, but lateral time (0.0) indicates immediate risk of collision.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 1.5
- Overall Risk Score: 1
