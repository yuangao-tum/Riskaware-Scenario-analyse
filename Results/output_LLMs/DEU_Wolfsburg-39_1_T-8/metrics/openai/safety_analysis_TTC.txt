Safety analysis for timestep 0.7 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 0.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20048
  - Relative Direction: Collision
  - Distance Risk Reason: Exact longitudinal alignment with a distance of 0.0 meters means an unavoidable collision.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 0
  - Time Risk Reason: Exact longitudinal alignment and time to collision is also 0.0 seconds indicating an immediate collision.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Risk Score: 0

- Obstacle ID: 20141
  - Relative Direction: Front
  - Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance is 6.86m indicating an acute proximity that presents a serious risk of collision, with 0.0m laterally, meaning exact lateral alignment.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 3
  - Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal time to collision of 1.5 seconds is a critical indicator of imminent collision, lateral time is 0.0 seconds confirming direct approach.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 0
  - Overall Risk Score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 20155
  - Relative Direction: Behind
  - Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance of 16.97m suggests a controlled scenario with no immediate collision risk laterally.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4
  - Time Risk Reason: Longitudinally, the time to collision is 2.6 seconds, allowing time to react, and 0.0 seconds laterally indicating exact alignment but from behind.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 4
  - Overall Risk Score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 20112
  - Relative Direction: Front
  - Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance of 38.63m shows significant space, with 0.0m laterally means itâ€™s straight in front of the vehicle.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Time Risk Reason: Time to collision is 6.41 seconds longitudinally with 0.0 seconds laterally showing that there is ample time and no immediate interference.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Risk Score: 5
