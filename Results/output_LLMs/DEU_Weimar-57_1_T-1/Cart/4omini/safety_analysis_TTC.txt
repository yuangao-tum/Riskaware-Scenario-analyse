Safety analysis for the last timestep (9.2 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 9.2 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The ego vehicle is at (12.3368, -0.0312) and the obstacle is located at (-9.7167, -2.4178). The distance is significant and in a different lanelet, thus the lateral distance minimizes collision risk.
   - Distance safety score: 5

   - Time Risk reason: Also stationary, yielding no time to collision.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

9. **Obstacle ID: 25**
   - Distance Risk reason: A moderate distance exists; both are moving but far apart.
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: Moving at a speed of 1.8457 but trajectory and distance indicate no immediate threat.
   - Time safety score: 4
   - Overall Risk score: 4

10. **Obstacle ID: 30**
   - Distance Risk reason: Significantly distant; in a different lanelet, the risk remains negligible.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: Stationary; therefore no conflict in time to collision.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

11. **Obstacle ID: 32**
   - Distance Risk reason: The distance and direction remaining stable leads to lesser chances of collision.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: Moving with speed but manageable trajectory; thus no immediate alarm for collision risks.
   - Time safety score: 4
   - Overall Risk score: 4

12. **Obstacle ID: 35**
   - Distance Risk reason: Distance from the obstacle is considerable hence excluding collision threats.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: Moving at a low speed yet still not a threat due to the distance from the ego vehicle.
   - Time safety score: 4
   - Overall Risk score: 4

13. **Obstacle ID: 38**
   - Distance Risk reason: Again, a far distance indicates minimal threat.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: The speed remains low and distance manageable.
   - Time safety score: 4
   - Overall Risk score: 4

14. **Obstacle ID: 39**
   - Distance Risk reason: The separation from the ego vehicle remains distinctly far, belonging to a different lanelet.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: Is effectively static; poses no risk.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

15. **Obstacle ID: 42**
   - Distance Risk reason: Marked distance with lanelet separation indicates no risk.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: No movement assures no conflicts of collision.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

16. **Obstacle ID: 44**
   - Distance Risk reason: Sufficiently far with a different lanelet mitigates risk.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: Moving with speed but considerably away precludes collision risk.
   - Time safety score: 4
   - Overall Risk score: 4

17. **Obstacle ID: 45**
   - Distance Risk reason: Very far distance suggests negligible risk.
   - Distance safety score: 5

   - Time Risk reason: Likewise is immutable as it does not accelerate towards the ego vehicle.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

20. **Obstacle ID: 51**
   - Distance Risk reason: The distance remains manageable but with proximity within the lanelet of the ego vehicle; however, movement is minimal.
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: Slight movement of 0.0066 doesn't signify any collision beforehand. 
   - Time safety score: 4
   - Overall Risk score: 4
