Safety analysis for the last timestep (9.2 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario for collision risks:

1. First, identifying the ego vehicle's trajectory:
- Ego vehicle is in lanelet 832
- Position around (12.3-12.4, 0.0)
- Moving very slowly with low velocity and deceleration

2. Main risk considerations:
- Obstacles in lanelet 832 (same as ego)
- Obstacles in adjacent/intersecting lanelets
- Relative positions and velocities

Safety Analysis for Key Obstacles:

Obstacle ID 17:
- Distance Risk: Moderate - Located in same lanelet 832 but maintaining safe distance (~8m)
- Distance Score: 4
- Time Risk: Low - Moving ahead with increasing velocity but safe separation
- Time Score: 4 
- Overall Score: 4

Obstacle ID 25:
- Distance Risk: Low - Located in lanelet 832 but >14m ahead
- Distance Score: 4
- Time Risk: Low - Safe separation maintained
- Time Score: 4
- Overall Score: 4

Obstacle ID 7:
- Distance Risk: Low - In different lanelet (93)
- Distance Score: 5
- Time Risk: Low - Different trajectory
- Time Score: 5
- Overall Score: 5

Other obstacles are either:
- In different lanelets with no intersection
- Moving away from ego vehicle
- Maintaining safe distances

No immediate collision risks or extreme risks identified.

JSON Summary:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Key Findings:
1. The ego vehicle is moving very slowly with controlled deceleration
2. While there are multiple vehicles in lanelet 832, they maintain safe distances
3. No immediate collision risks or extreme risk situations detected
4. The scenario appears to be stable with vehicles maintaining safe separations and velocities

The overall scenario shows good safety margins with no critical collision risks identified. The ego vehicle's low speed provides additional safety buffer.
