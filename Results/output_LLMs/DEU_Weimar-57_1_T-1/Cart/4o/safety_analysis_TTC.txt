Safety analysis for the last timestep (9.2 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 9.2 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is stationary and positioned far ahead, minimizing immediate collision risks with a considerable distance sufficed by distinct lateral position.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Obstacle is static without any velocity and acceleration implying no imminent collision concerns.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 8**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Significant distance away along with no overlap in lanelets or trajectory path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Likely negligible concern due to static positioning and lack of velocity.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

3. **Obstacle ID: 10**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Adequate lateral and longitudinal separation entirely mitigating collision likelihood.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Static obstacle retains no capability to intersect paths imminently.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

4. **Obstacle ID: 12**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Large lateral separation and primarily stationary ensure no collision engagement.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: No movement negates time-dependent collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

5. **Obstacle ID: 16**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static positioning with lanelet disjunction establishes minimal collision risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity absence translates to zero collision timing concern.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

6. **Obstacle ID: 17**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In same lanelet but sufficient lateral and longitudinal distances inferred minimizing immediate risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity and rotational scoring lack urgency necessities in evasion behaviour.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

7. **Obstacle ID: 19 to 53**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: All show satisfactory lateral or longitudinal distancing, none within the ego's immediate trajectory.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Stationary or slow-moving figures with no interferences yet direct engagement.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 
   - **Each Overall Risk score**: 5

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

All identified obstacles exhibit sufficiently low risk levels due to either static status or ample distance, therefore negating extreme collision concerns.
