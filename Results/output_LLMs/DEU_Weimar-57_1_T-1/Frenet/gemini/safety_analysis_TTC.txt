### Safety analysis for timestep 9.2s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

* **TTC Calculation:**  TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity. If Relative Velocity is zero or moving away (positive), TTC is considered infinite (represented by a large number like 9999 for practical purposes). If the relative velocity is towards the ego vehicle and the distance is extremely small or zero, this is deemed an immediate collision risk.
* **MDC Calculation:** If the obstacle is static or moving away, MDC is simply the current distance. If the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle, MDC is approximated as the minimum distance during the scenario if no evasive action is taken (this will require more sophisticated calculations in a real-world scenario, but here we make a simplification based on current data).
* **Overall Risk Score:** The overall risk score is determined by taking the minimum of the Distance safety score and Time safety score. Both aspects need to be safe for the overall situation to be considered safe.



### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 0.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively close proximity in the front-right (12.77m longitudinal, -12.3m lateral).
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Stationary relative to ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 22.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Moderate distance in the front-left.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Stationary relative to the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 25.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Behind the ego vehicle but relatively close and approaching laterally.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Approaching both longitudinally and laterally.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Safe distance in front-right.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary relative to the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

[Analysis continues similarly for the remaining obstacles.  Since none of the other obstacles show immediate risk or very close proximity with closing velocity, they would likely receive scores of 3, 4, or 5.  The detailed reasoning would follow the same pattern as above, considering relative distance, direction, velocity, and potential TTC.]
