### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30749.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal 45.1 m and lateral 22.11 m poses no immediate concern as the ego vehicle is somewhat far from this obstacle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal velocity indicates the obstacle is approaching at -1.96 m/s. However, the distance allows for some time before a potential collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30750.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal 18.97 m and lateral -1.89 m indicates a proximity threat, as it's relatively close.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Approaching at -1.96 m/s longitudinally at this distance equates to about 9.66 seconds till potential collision, though itâ€™s close laterally.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30751.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal 27.67 m and lateral 14.08 m suggests manageable proximity.

  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30752.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinally 45.17 m and laterally 14.25 m indicates safe distance offsets.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Approaching at -1.96 m/s, leading to a safe TTC.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30753.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinally 45.02 m and laterally 31.72 m provides a considerable buffer.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: -1.94 m/s impact rate allows for a safe collision-free time period.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30754.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinally 19.0 m and aligned laterally means it deserves attention as it is directly before the vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2
  - **Time Risk reason**: High longitudinal speed (-1.96 m/s) means it can lead to collision soon if not evaded.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30755.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of 19.02 m and laterally 1.89 m indicates it is approaching whilst being close enough for concern.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Problematic time risk at about 9.7 seconds for possible impact.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30756.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinally 44.91 m and laterally 43.48 m creates a safe buffer.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: With a speed approach of -1.93 m/s, the vehicle is safe timing-wise.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30757.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Combining a longitudinal distance of 19.04 m and lateral positioning makes it concerning again.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Similar longitudinal risky approach issue around 9.68 seconds.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30758.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is troubling at 11.37 m and slightly laterally aligned.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2
  - **Time Risk reason**: The speed risks collision approaching in about 5.95 seconds.
  - **Time safety score**: 2
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2
  
- **Obstacle ID: 30763.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinally 7.14 m and laterally -1.89 m flying into danger zone.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2
