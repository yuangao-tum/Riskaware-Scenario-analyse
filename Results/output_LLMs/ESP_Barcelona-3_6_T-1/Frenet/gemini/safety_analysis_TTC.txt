### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**General Notes:**  Since precise ego vehicle motion isn't given, TTC calculations assume constant relative velocity, which is a simplification.  A negative TTC indicates the collision has likely already happened if the velocity and acceleration data is correct. MDC is calculated as the closest approach based on constant relative velocities if TTC exists. If the TTC is negative and acceleration is present in the opposite direction of velocity, it signifies that the vehicle likely already had a near miss and might be moving away from it.

**Methodology:**

1. **TTC Calculation:**  TTC = -Relative Distance / Relative Velocity. If the relative velocity is zero or away from the ego vehicle, TTC is considered infinite (for practical purposes, a large value is used for scoring).

2. **MDC Calculation:**  If TTC exists (positive), MDC is the minimum Euclidean distance between the ego and the obstacle calculated using constant velocity projections of their positions. If no collision is projected, MDC is the perpendicular distance to the obstacle's trajectory, which is set to the current Euclidean distance in the case of zero relative velocity. If the TTC is zero, then the Euclidean distance is reported as is. If TTC is negative, MDC is theoretically the current distance at the given time step (since collision already may have happened), then no MDC calculation is required in such cases.

3. **Risk Score Assignment:** Risk scores are assigned based on TTC, MDC, and relative directions.  The lower the TTC and MDC, and the more head-on the approach (front, front-left, front-right), the higher the risk.
