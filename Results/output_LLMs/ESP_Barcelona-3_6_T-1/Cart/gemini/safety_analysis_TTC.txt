Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.6 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories, dimensions of vehicles, and lanelet geometries aren't provided, I'm making simplified assumptions for demonstration:

* **TTC (Time to Collision):**  Approximated using relative velocity and distance.  A more accurate calculation would involve predicted trajectories.  I will consider TTC in both longitudinal (along the lanelet) and lateral (across the lanelet) directions separately (TTClong, TTClat).  If the relative velocity suggests objects are moving apart, TTC is considered infinite.
* **MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision):** Approximated using current positions. A more robust analysis would use predicted trajectories. I will consider longitudinal and lateral distances.
* **Lanelet-Based Risk:**  Obstacles in different lanelets are initially assumed to have lower risk.  However, lane changes and interactions near lane boundaries are important factors I'll qualitatively assess.
* **Thresholds:** I will use approximate distance and time thresholds for assigning risk scores. These would need to be calibrated based on the specific autonomous driving system's requirements. For the purpose of this example, I will define critical TTClong or TTClat as less than 2.5 seconds and critical MDC (longitudinal or lateral) as less than 2 meters.
