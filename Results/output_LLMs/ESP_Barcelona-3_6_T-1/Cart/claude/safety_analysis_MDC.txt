Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.6 seconds):
Let me analyze the collision risks in this scenario.

### Safety Analysis Key Findings:

1. Most Critical Obstacle - ID 30763:
- Distance Risk: Vehicle 30763 is in close proximity (approximately 6-7 meters) in the same trajectory path (lanelet 3652/3653).
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk: Relative velocities and trajectories indicate potential collision risk within 3-4 seconds
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

2. Secondary Risk - ID 30754:
- Distance Risk: Located in lanelet 1170, adjacent to ego vehicle's path
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk: Stationary vehicle, but in close proximity
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

3. Other Notable Risks:
- Vehicle 30762 and 30764: Maintaining safe distance but in parallel lanelets
- Multiple vehicles (30749-30768) present but at safe distances and different lanelets

### Key Safety Metrics:
- Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC): ~6 meters (with vehicle 30763)
- Time to Collision (TTC): ~3.5 seconds (with vehicle 30763)

No immediate collisions detected, but high attention needed for vehicle 30763.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

While there are vehicles with risk scores of 2 and 3, there are no vehicles with immediate collision risk (score 0) or extreme risk (score 1). The situation requires caution but is currently manageable with proper defensive driving.

Key recommendations:
1. Maintain current speed and trajectory
2. Monitor vehicle 30763 closely
3. Be prepared for sudden changes in vehicle 30754's behavior
4. Maintain safe following distance

The ego vehicle appears to be executing a safe maneuver while maintaining appropriate distances from surrounding vehicles.
