Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.6 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6 seconds:
In this analysis, we will evaluate each of the obstacles relative to the ego vehicle, assessing the Distance (MDC) and Time to Collision (TTC) to provide a risk score for each obstacle.

#### Key parameters for calculations:
1. Ego vehicle position: (-100.1182, -180.3965)
2. Ego velocity: 1.9612 m/s
3. Obstacles are evaluated based on their coordinates, velocities, and positions relative to the ego vehicle.

### Summary in JSON Format: 
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

### Conclusion:
Most obstacles pose a low to medium collision risk, with the highest risk related to a few rapidly approaching obstacles. None present immediate collision risks, so no extreme or collision risks were identified based on the provided metrics.
