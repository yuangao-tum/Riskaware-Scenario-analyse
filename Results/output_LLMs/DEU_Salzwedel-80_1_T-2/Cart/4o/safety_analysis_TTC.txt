  - **Time safety score:** 4
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20032.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned approximately 58 meters away in a different lanelet.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Moving in another direction with negligible risk due to the distance.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20034.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Roughly 64 meters away in a different lanelet.

  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20035.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Moves in converging path but is approximately 230 meters away.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** There's a major distance buffer to negate immediate time threat.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20036.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned closer to 76 meters away on a distinct lanelet path.
