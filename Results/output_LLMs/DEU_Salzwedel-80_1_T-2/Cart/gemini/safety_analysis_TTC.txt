Safety analysis for the last timestep (13.1 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 13.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* **TTC Calculation:**  Without precise trajectory predictions, accurate TTC is difficult.  I'll provide an *estimated* TTC based on current velocities and positions.  A more robust analysis would involve predictive models for vehicle behavior.
* **MDC Calculation:** This will be a straight-line distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle. A more refined analysis would consider vehicle shapes and orientations.
* **Lateral and Longitudinal TTC/DTC:** Without lane information and vehicle headings, separating lateral and longitudinal components is an approximation. My estimations assume a simplified road model.
* **Overall Risk:** This is a synthesized score based on TTC, MDC, and the general situation.
