Safety analysis for the last timestep (13.1 seconds):
To evaluate the potential collision risks for the ego vehicle, we will follow the steps outlined.

### Steps:
1. **Identify obstacles in the same lanelet or trajectory as the ego vehicle.**
   The ego vehicle is in lanelet 2629.0. We will look for obstacles located in the same lanelet (2629.0) and consider those with a trajectory direction that may intersect with the ego vehicle's path.

2. **Calculate the metrics (TTC, MDC):** 
   - **TTC**: Time until potential collision calculated by the distance to collision divided by the relative velocity between the ego vehicle and the obstacle.
   - **MDC**: The smallest distance between the ego vehicle and the obstacles before a collision would occur.

### Safety analysis for timestep 13.1 seconds: 
Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
#### 1. Obstacle ID: 20017.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle with a velocity of 14.4498 m/s while the ego is moving with a velocity of 4.2348 m/s in the same lanelet. Significant lateral distance exists.
- **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk) - Close to collision path due to the speed differential.
- **Time Risk reason:** As the obstacle is approaching rapidly, the TTC considers the diminishing distance relative to the speed. Estimated time to collision based on current relative speed indicates high urgency.
- **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk) - Close to collision based on approach speed.
- **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

#### 2. Obstacle ID: 20022.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is also traveling towards the ego vehicle at 14.5531 m/s, with concerns from lateral distance.
- **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk) - The lanelet overlap creates a potential for collision.
- **Time Risk reason:** The approach speed to the ego vehicle is again high, leaving minimal time to react.
- **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk) - Immediate action would be needed considering approach speed.
- **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

#### 3. Obstacle ID: 20024.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Moving towards the ego vehicle at 14.5145 m/s from the same lanelet.
- **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk) - There is a significant speed differential that increases the likelihood of a collision.
- **Time Risk reason:** Given the speed and the small distance, the time until collision is limited, requiring swift maneuvers.
- **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk) - Highest urgency due to swift approach.
- **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

#### 4. Obstacle ID: 20035.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle has a velocity of 14.6035 m/s approaching the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk) - Approaching trajectory in the same lane.
- **Time Risk reason:** Much like the others, a high speed brings about an urgent situation for the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk) - Collision potential is imminent given the speed.
- **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

#### 5. Obstacle ID: 20037.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Moving at a speed of 14.1238 m/s, it shares a trajectory with the ego.
- **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk) - Close enough to warrant concern.
- **Time Risk reason:** The close proximity and high velocity indicate an urgent response is required.
- **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk) - Alert for possible collision immediately.
- **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
The overall assessment shows no obstacles with a collision score of 0 and no extreme risk score of 1. Hereâ€™s the summary:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

### Conclusion:
The evaluation indicates a high risk (score of 2) for several obstacles in close proximity to the ego vehicle. Precautionary actions should be taken to avoid a potential collision as the predicted time until collision is not favorable.
