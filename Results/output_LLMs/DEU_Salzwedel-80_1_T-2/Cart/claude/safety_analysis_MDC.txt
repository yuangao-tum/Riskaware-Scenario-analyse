Safety analysis for the last timestep (13.1 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario for collision risks based on the provided data.

1. First, identifying relevant obstacles:
- Ego vehicle is initially in lanelet 5429, then moves to lanelet 2629
- Most critical obstacles appear to be those in nearby or intersecting lanelets

2. Detailed Safety Analysis:

For Obstacle 20039:
- Initially at (-1.4279, -2.2791) crossing path with ego
- Distance Risk Reason: Close lateral proximity during crossing trajectory
- Distance Safety Score: 2 (High risk due to crossing paths)
- Time Risk Reason: Short TTC during crossing maneuver
- Time Safety Score: 2 (High risk due to intersecting trajectories)
- Overall Risk Score: 2

For Obstacle 20029:
- Initially at (-10.8187, -9.0566) in lanelet 1153
- Distance Risk Reason: Moderate distance from ego vehicle
- Distance Safety Score: 3 (Medium risk due to parallel movement)
- Time Risk Reason: Moderate TTC with converging paths
- Time Safety Score: 3 (Medium risk due to similar direction)
- Overall Risk Score: 3

For Obstacle 20030:
- Starting position close to ego vehicle
- Distance Risk Reason: Initially close proximity but diverging paths
- Distance Safety Score: 3 (Medium risk initially)
- Time Risk Reason: Increasing separation over time
- Time Safety Score: 4 (Low risk due to diverging trajectories)
- Overall Risk Score: 3

No obstacles present immediate collision risks (score 0) or extreme risks (score 1) in this scenario. The main interactions show moderate to high risks but with sufficient spacing and time for reaction.

JSON Summary:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Key Findings:
1. Most obstacles maintain safe distances from the ego vehicle
2. No imminent collisions detected
3. Several moderate risk situations managed through vehicle spacing and speed differentials
4. Multiple vehicles in parallel lanelets but with sufficient spacing for safe operation
5. Crossing trajectories well managed with adequate time gaps

The scenario shows generally safe operation with normal traffic interactions and no immediate safety concerns requiring emergency intervention.
