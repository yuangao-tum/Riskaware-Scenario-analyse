### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20029.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20016.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

The analysis shows that Obstacle 20029.0 has a collision risk, while Obstacles 20016.0, 20025.0, and 20031.0 are categorized under extreme risk due to their proximity and velocity, indicating that the ego vehicle should take immediate corrective action in their presence. All other obstacles are largely evaluated as low or negligible risk.
