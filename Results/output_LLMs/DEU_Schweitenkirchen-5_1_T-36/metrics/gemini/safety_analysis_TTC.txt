### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 0
- Relative Direction: Rear-left
- Distance Risk Reason: Both DTClong (128.37) and DTClat (37.6) are > 5, indicating negligible risk from the rear-left.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
- Time Risk Reason: Both TTClong (Infinity) and TTClat (Infinity) are > 5, indicating negligible risk from the rear-left.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 2

- Obstacle ID: 521
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong (103.07) > 5 and DTClat (3.22) > 1, suggesting low lateral risk.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5
- Time Risk Reason: Both TTClong (Infinity) and TTClat (Infinity) indicate negligible time risk.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 527
- Relative Direction: Front
- Distance Risk Reason:  DTClong (45.66) > 5 and DTClat (0.0) suggests no lateral risk as it is directly in front.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong (Infinity) indicates negligible risk.  TTClat (0.0) needs further investigation, but is likely an artifact of the direct front alignment.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 542

- Time Risk Reason: TTClong (0.0) and TTClat (13.72) indicate collision. 
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Risk Score: 0

... (Analysis for other Obstacles are similar, with most scoring 5, and Obstacle 625 representing a collision)


- Obstacle ID: 625
- Relative Direction: Collision
- Distance Risk Reason: Both DTClong (0.0) and DTClat (0.0) are 0, indicating a collision.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
