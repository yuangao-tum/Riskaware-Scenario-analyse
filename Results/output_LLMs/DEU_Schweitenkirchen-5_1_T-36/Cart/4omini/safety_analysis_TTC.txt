Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.8 seconds):
To analyze the potential collision risk in the provided scenario, we need to focus on the position, orientation, velocity, and acceleration of the ego vehicle in relation to each obstacle. The following calculations and analyses will help us assess the Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) for each relevant obstacle.

### Steps for Evaluation:

1. **Identify Relevant Obstacles**: We will consider only those obstacles that exist in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (lanelet 179.0) or those whose intended trajectory intersects with the ego vehicle's path.

2. **Calculate Metrics**: For each obstacle, we will calculate the TTC and MDC. Specifically, we will check longitudinal and lateral distances to derive both values for each obstacle.

3. **Evaluate Risks**: We'll evaluate risk levels based on the calculated TTC and MDC, categorizing them from 0-5 according to the definitions provided above.

### Safety analysis for timestep 5.8 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID:** 17.0
   - Distance Risk reason: The relative position of the ego vehicle and obstacle indicates they are on a converging path.
   - Distance safety score: 2 (Close to collision).
   - Time Risk reason: TTC indicates there is a high probability of collision soon.
   - Time safety score: 2 (Close to collision).
   - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk).

2. **Obstacle ID:** 18.0
   - Distance Risk reason: They are moving towards each other with no lateral space.
   - Distance safety score: 2 (Close to collision).
   - Time Risk reason: TTC is low due to the speed difference; a timely maneuver would be necessary.
   - Time safety score: 2 (Close to collision).
   - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk).

3. **Obstacle ID:** 51.0
   - Distance Risk reason: They are relatively aligned on a collision course.
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Moderate collision risk).
   - Time Risk reason: The speed and distance suggest some potential for timely reaction.
   - Time safety score: 3 (Moderate collision risk).
   - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).

4. **Obstacle ID:** 122.0
   - Distance Risk reason: The distance is somewhat minimal, indicating potential for conflict.
   - Distance safety score: 2 (Close to collision).
   - Time Risk reason: The speed difference suggests a prompt reaction is required.
   - Time safety score: 2 (Close to collision).
   - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk).

5. **Obstacle ID:** 205.0
   - Distance Risk reason: The distance is still manageable, but movement aligns towards a potential conflict.
   - Distance safety score: 4 (Minimal collision risk).
   - Time Risk reason: Adequate time to execute a safe avoidance maneuver.
   - Time safety score: 4 (Minimal collision risk).
   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk).

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```
### Conclusion:
In this scenario, no immediate collisions have been detected, but several obstacles present high and medium collision risks indicating that management (such as lane changes, speed regulation, etc.) is necessary to ensure safety in the upcoming seconds. The evaluations emphasize the need for prompt maneuvering actions, especially concerning obstacles with a high risk rating.
