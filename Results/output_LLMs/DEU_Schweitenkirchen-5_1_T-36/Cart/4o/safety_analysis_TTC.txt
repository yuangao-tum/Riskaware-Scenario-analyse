Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.8 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.8: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

To proceed with the evaluation, let's break down the steps:

1. **Identify obstacles in the same lanelet or trajectory as the ego vehicle:**
   - The ego vehicle is currently located in lanelet 179.0.
   - Obstacles located in the same lanelet or potentially intersecting trajectories: Obstacle IDs: 17.0, 18.0, 51.0, 122.0, 187.0, 213.0, 228.0, 250.0, 327.0, 542.0, 625.0, 648.0.

2. **Calculate the following metrics:**
   
   For each obstacle, the Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) should be assessed. These values are based on the longitudinal and lateral relative velocity, acceleration, and position between the ego vehicle and each obstacle. As exact TTC and MDC cannot be calculated without a detailed simulation of trajectories, assumptions will be made based on given velocities and accelerations.

3. **Obstacle Analysis:**

   #### Obstacle ID: 17.0
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Located in the same lanelet and relatively close.

   - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4
   
   #### Obstacle ID: 228.0
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Closely interacting path.
   - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** High velocity with slowing obstacles suggests careful monitoring.
   - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 3
   
   #### Obstacle ID: 250.0
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Similar orientation, relatively unproblematic path.

   - **Time Risk reason:** Arcing away from trajectory.
   - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4
   
   #### Obstacle ID: 648.0
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Closing in but tangential orientations imply safety.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Relative paths create increased space over time.
   - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4
   
### Summary in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

In this scenario, no obstacles are identified with a direct collision risk (Overall Risk Score: 0) or extreme risk (Overall Risk Score: 1). Most obstacles around the vehicle remain at Medium Risk or lower with controllable circumstances.
