Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.8 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.8: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

*  Since the provided scenario lacks critical information like obstacle dimensions, lane widths, and precise trajectories, a comprehensive TTC/MDC calculation is impossible.  We'll perform a *qualitative* assessment based on position, velocity, and lanelet information.  
* "Longitudinal" and "lateral" TTC/MDC are difficult to determine without trajectory predictions. We'll consider the general motion relative to the ego vehicle.
* I'm assuming lanelets 162, 163, and 164 are somewhat parallel and close to lanelet 179 based on the obstacle distribution.  Lanelets 177 and 178 are also assumed to be near the ego vehicle's lanelet.  Lanelets 152-155 are considered further away and less of a direct risk.  These are educated guesses based on typical road structures.
* The orientation values seem to be in radians.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**General Approach:** Obstacles in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (179) and those with closing velocities pose the highest risk.  Obstacles in nearby lanelets (162, 163, 164, 177, 178) are assessed based on relative position and velocity.  Obstacles in lanelets 152-155 are generally deemed lower risk unless explicitly stated otherwise.

**(Repeating for each obstacle)**

- **Obstacle ID: 0.0**
- Distance Risk reason: In lanelet 164, relatively close, and moving faster than ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Potential for future conflict if obstacle 0.0 changes lanes or ego vehicle needs to maneuver into lanelet 164.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 2.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in distant lanelet 155.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No apparent conflict.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


... (Repeat this analysis for all obstacles. Pay close attention to obstacles in lanelets 179, 177, 178, 162, 163, 164.  Evaluate relative positions and velocities to assign risk scores.) ...


- **Obstacle ID: 648.0**
- Distance Risk reason: In lanelet 179 (same as ego) and behind, but moving considerably faster.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Could become a concern if ego vehicle decelerates significantly or obstacle 648.0 maintains high acceleration.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Summary in JSON Format:
(This JSON would be populated with any obstacles that have an Overall Risk Score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk). If no such obstacles exist after your qualitative assessment, the entries remain null.)
