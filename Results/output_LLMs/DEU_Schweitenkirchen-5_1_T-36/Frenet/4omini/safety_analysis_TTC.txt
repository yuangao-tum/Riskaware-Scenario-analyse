- **Obstacle ID:** 8.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is 132.3 m and lateral distance is 27.87 m. The obstacle is getting closer.
  - **Distance safety score:** 2
  - **Time Risk reason:** Rapidly approaching with a longitudinal velocity of -44.41 m/s shows an immediate concern.
  - **Time safety score:** 2
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2

- **Obstacle ID:** 13.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is 487.24 m and lateral distance is 79.64 m. It's threatening due to its approach but is still at a distance.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3
  - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal velocity indicates close-approaching, concerned with potential collision soon.
  - **Time safety score:** 2
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2

- **Obstacle ID:** 15.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is 579.14 m and lateral distance is 96.89 m. Approaching with significant speed.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3
  - **Time Risk reason:** It is rapidly moving toward the ego vehicle at -42.31 m/s.
  - **Time safety score:** 2
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2

- **Obstacle ID:** 44.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is 168.43 m and lateral distance is 30.61 m. It is getting closer.
  - **Distance safety score:** 2
  - **Time Risk reason:** Approaching quickly at -44.39 m/s longitudinally.
  - **Time safety score:** 2
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2

- **Obstacle ID:** 75.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance is 76.09 m and lateral distance is 10.01 m. The obstacle is quite close and moving toward the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score:** 2
  - **Time Risk reason:** Moving toward the vehicle at a relative velocity which indicates a high potential for collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 1
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1

- **Obstacle ID:** 625.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Exact collision point as it's at 0.0 m distance.
  - **Distance safety score:** 0
  - **Time Risk reason:** Exact point of collision; collision is unavoidable at this point.
  - **Time safety score:** 0
  - **Overall Risk score:** 0

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "625.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "null",
        "OverallRiskScore": "null"
    }
}
``` 

### Conclusion:
There is a definite collision risk with obstacle ID 625.0 at this timestep with a score of 0. The other obstacles, while risky, do not reach an extreme risk level. Regular monitoring and adjustment are crucial for safe navigation through the area containing the identified obstacles.
