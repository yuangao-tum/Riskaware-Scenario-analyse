### Safety analysis for timestep 5.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

The provided scenario information lacks crucial data for precise TTC and MDC calculations. Specifically, the ego vehicle's velocity and acceleration are missing. Without these, we can only perform a qualitative risk assessment based on relative motion and distances.  We will assume the ego vehicle is traveling at a constant velocity for a simplified estimation in some cases. This assumption is not ideal but provides a starting point given the data limitations.

A general approach for TTC and MDC estimation, *when ego vehicle motion information is available*, is outlined below:

**TTC Calculation (Longitudinal and Lateral):**

* **TTC_longitudinal = - (DTC_longitudinal / V_rel_longitudinal)**  if V_rel_longitudinal < 0 (closing velocity)
* **TTC_lateral = - (DTC_lateral / V_rel_lateral)** if V_rel_lateral < 0 (closing velocity)

If the relative velocity is positive (moving away), TTC is considered infinite, indicating no longitudinal or lateral collision risk.

**MDC Calculation:**

MDC calculation requires considering both longitudinal and lateral motion over time.  A simplified estimate can be made if we assume constant velocities and no evasive actions:

* Calculate the relative positions over time using relative velocities.
* Find the minimum distance between the ego vehicle and the obstacle based on these trajectories.


**Obstacle-Specific Analysis:**

The following analysis applies the above principles with the available data, highlighting the limitations due to missing ego-vehicle information.


* **Obstacles with potential risk (Obstacles approaching ego car longitudinally): 7.0, 8.0, 13.0, 15.0, 16.0, 30.0, 44.0, 50.0, 57.0, 64.0, 66.0, 72.0, 76.0, 77.0, 79.0, 81.0, 82.0, 83.0, 86.0, 87.0, 96.0, 98.0, 100.0, 108.0, 109.0, 117.0, 119.0, 121.0, 127.0, 130.0, 134.0, 135.0, 136.0, 139.0, 149.0, 156.0, 158.0, 165.0, 166.0, 171.0, 175.0, 192.0, 199.0, 201.0, 204.0, 207.0, 212.0, 215.0, 216.0, 217.0, 219.0, 255.0, 267.0, 270.0, 301.0, 303.0, 310.0, 350.0, 355.0, 356.0, 400.0, 410.0, 417.0, 420.0, 427.0, 448.0, 458.0, 469.0, 470.0, 487.0, 496.0, 497.0, 501.0, 531.0, 551.0, 562.0, 563.0, 580.0, 583.0, 584.0, 588.0, 627.0, 631.0, 632.0:**

For these obstacles, we need ego vehicle information to properly calculate TTC. Based purely on the fact they are approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally and laterally, their risk varies from medium to high (2-3).  Closer obstacles like 7.0, 8.0, and 30.0 represent potentially higher risk due to their proximity. We cannot definitively determine whether a collision is imminent without knowing the ego vehicle's speed and direction.


* **Obstacles moving away from ego car (All others):** These present negligible risk (5) as they are moving away from the ego vehicle in both longitudinal and lateral directions.  Although their relative acceleration might vary, their current motion significantly reduces collision probability.

* **Obstacles 592.0, 634.0, and 648.0:  Approaching from behind:**  These require careful attention, particularly 648.0 and 634.0, which are very close.  Again, without ego vehicle speed, a proper TTC cannot be calculated, but their risk is likely medium to high (2-3). Obstacle 592.0 is farther away and might be overtaking, representing less immediate risk.

* **Obstacles 542.0, 625.0: Laterally close/Aligned:**
    * **542.0:**  This obstacle is directly to the left and quite close laterally. It represents a medium to high risk (2-3) depending on the ego vehicle's lateral movement. 
    * **625.0:** This obstacle is listed as a "Collision."  This means TTC and MDC are both effectively zero, so this obstacle gets a risk score of 0.

* **Obstacles 594.0:** While moving away longitudinally, it's very close and moving towards the ego vehicle laterally, representing a medium risk (3).
