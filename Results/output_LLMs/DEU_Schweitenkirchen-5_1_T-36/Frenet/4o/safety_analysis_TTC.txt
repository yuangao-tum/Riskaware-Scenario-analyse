### Safety analysis for timestep 5.8 seconds: 
Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 0.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** Obstacle is in the rear-left, with DTClong = -128.37 m and DTClat = 37.6 m, indicating it is far away and moving away from the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance Safety Score:** 5
   - **Time Risk Reason:** With a high relative speed moving away (-53.13 m/s), there's no collision risk in the short term.
   - **Time Safety Score:** 5
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 7.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** Positioned relatively close in the front-left with DTClong = 167.1 m and DTClat = 34.03 m. However, given direction, there's a likely converging trajectory.
   - **Distance Safety Score:** 3
   - **Time Risk Reason:** Negative relative velocity (-44.23 m/s) indicates it is closing towards the ego vehicle, but still with room for maneuver.
   - **Time Safety Score:** 3
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 3

3. **Obstacle ID: 8.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** Similar to obstacle 7.0, it is close and converging at a similar path at DTClong = 132.3 m and DTClat = 27.87 m.
   - **Distance Safety Score:** 2
   - **Time Risk Reason:** Higher closing speed (-44.41 m/s) increases the risk of quick convergence.
   - **Time Safety Score:** 2
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 2

4. **Obstacle ID: 625.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** Positioned at exactly DTClong = 0 m and DTClat = 0 m implies a current overlap with the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance Safety Score:** 0
   - **Time Risk Reason:** Overlapping implies immediate collision already occurred with the given velocities.
   - **Time Safety Score:** 0
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 0

5. **Obstacle ID: 79.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** Front-left position and DTClong = 263.68 m and DTClat = 44.18 m suggests a moderate risk due to converging path.
   - **Distance Safety Score:** 3
   - **Time Risk Reason:** Negative closing speed (-46.14 m/s) makes it a potential risk for future collision.
   - **Time Safety Score:** 3
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 3

6. **Obstacle ID: 167.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** Positioned farther out at DTClong = 973.69 m and DTClat = 206.43 m indicates being well out of imminent collision path.
   - **Distance Safety Score:** 5
   - **Time Risk Reason:** Moving away with both longitudinal and lateral positive velocities.
   - **Time Safety Score:** 5
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 5

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "625.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

The analysis output highlighted the collision at Obstacle ID 625.0 where immediate actions may be required if these obstacles don't change trajectory or the ego vehicle does not maneuver to a safer course. Extreme risk levels were not identified outside the collision case.
