Safety analysis for the last timestep (14.0 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 14.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 3515.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (lanelet 595.0) and is moving at a significantly higher speed (8.6067 m/s) compared to the ego vehicle (0.4303 m/s). The distance is relatively large which lowers the risk at this moment.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The Time to Collision (TTC) is calculated based on relative speed and current distance. Given the distance and speed difference, it is difficult to predict an imminent collision, leading to a reasonably high time score.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 3518.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is also in a different lanelet (lanelet 2100.0). Its speed (7.8419 m/s) is also greater than that of the ego vehicle initially. Distance is adequate to assess a low risk of collision.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Similar reasoning applies regarding TTC and the distance. The likelihood of a collision is quite low due to speed differences.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 3519.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is in lanelet 268.0 but also at a distance. The considerable gap decreases risk as the obstacle also travels faster than the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The TTC indicates that a collision is not imminent considering the current states, allowing for a two-way safe interaction.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 3520.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in the same lanelet (lanelet 1315.0), this obstacle is moving quickly (7.2906 m/s). However, it is not closing in on the ego vehicle significantly due to diverse trajectories.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The speed difference and trajectory suggest more manageable time separation even if a potential conflict exists. Thus the risk is assessed as moderate.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 3522.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Similar to 3520.0, it shares the lanelet but the distance remains ample and the speed can allow for changes if needed.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The increased gap compared to movement lowers the chances of collision, leading to an adjusted score in this aspect.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 3523.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle's speed is quite aligned with the ego vehicle, leading to a nearness that raises moderate concern.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The potential for collision stays relevant as speeds are similar and trajectory alignment exists, hence a divided risk score.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 3525.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in lanelet 268, there is considerable space but also a notable velocity that could lead to collision scenarios if paths align.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Despite distance absence right now, the risk of collision in the near approach remains noteworthy leading to moderate concern assessment.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 3526.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Similar to 3525.0 with proximity in lanelet 268. The speeds give a concerning overlap leading to a medium risk evaluation.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Being vehicles travelling at similar velocities indicates a moderate risk of collision that needs further clearance.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 3527.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle maintains a medium risk state due to aligned directional paths and similar speed factors.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The moderate chances of collision create relevant concerns, hence the time risk evaluation stays aligned as moderate.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 3528.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Like others, positional factors coupled with similar velocities justify concern for potential collision scenarios.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Similar velocity and positioning ensure a moderate risk evaluation concerning collision.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
