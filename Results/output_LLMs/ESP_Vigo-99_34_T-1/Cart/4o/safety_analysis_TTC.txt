Safety analysis for the last timestep (14.0 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 14.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 3515.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is located in a different lanelet than the ego vehicle. The lateral distance is significant given the positions, reducing collision risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: With a higher velocity and located in a different lanelet, the obstacle is less likely to intersect the ego vehicle's path within a critical timeframe.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3518.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in a different lanelet with ample lateral distance, minimizing immediate collision potential.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's path is not converging with the ego vehicle in the near term.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3519.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is located on a different trajectory, further from the ego, and not posing any immediate collision threat.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Given its trajectory, it is not expected to interact with the ego vehicle imminently.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3520.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: In the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, but positioned behind and negatively accelerating; hence, no risk of collision.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: With both velocity and relative position indicating a diverging path, immediate collision risk is low.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 3522.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned behind the ego in the same lanelet, substantial distance present, reducing imminent risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: With current acceleration and trajectory, the obstacle doesn't pose an immediate threat.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 3523.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Aligned closely with the ego vehicle in the same lanelet, presenting a potential risk but with favorable lateral distance.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Although the trajectory nears the ego vehicleâ€™s path closely, current dynamics indicate enough time to react.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 3525.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located significantly away vertically and in different lanelets, not presently on a collision path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The velocity and path are diverging from potential collision with the ego.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3526.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Different lanelet and trajectory, alongside substantial lateral displacement, low direct collision probability.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Unlikely to interact spatially with the ego vehicle in the immediate future.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3527.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Part of another trajectory, with large geographic separation, minimising possible direct collision.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Velocity and direction do not suggest any likely convergence with the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3528.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Also part of a distinct path and lanelet, with adequate longitudinal separation.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The directional path is consistent with minimizing intensive collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Summary in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

In this scenario, none of the obstacles pose an immediate danger, resulting in no entities falling under collision or extreme risk categories.
