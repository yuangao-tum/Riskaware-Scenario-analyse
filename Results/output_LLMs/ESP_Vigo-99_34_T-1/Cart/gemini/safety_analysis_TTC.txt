Safety analysis for the last timestep (14.0 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 14.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories and dimensions of the vehicles are not provided,  I'm making some simplifying assumptions for this analysis.  I'll be primarily focusing on lanelet membership and relative velocities to determine risk.  A more precise analysis would require detailed trajectory predictions, vehicle dimensions, and sophisticated collision detection algorithms. 

For TTC and MDC,  I'll provide qualitative estimates based on the provided data:

* **TTC:**  Estimated by considering the closing velocity between the ego vehicle and the obstacle. If the vehicles are moving towards each other rapidly and in the same lanelet, the TTC will be considered low.
* **MDC:**  Estimated by considering the current distance between the ego vehicle and the obstacle. Obstacles closer to the ego vehicle will have lower MDC values.

**### Obstacle Analysis:**
