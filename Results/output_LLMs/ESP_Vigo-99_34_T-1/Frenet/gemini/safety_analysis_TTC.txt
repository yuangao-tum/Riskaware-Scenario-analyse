### Safety analysis for timestep 14.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3515.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately far behind and to the right, moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Closing longitudinally, but moving away laterally.  TTC calculation would need more future data to be reliable due to the negative longitudinal distance and positive longitudinal velocity.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3518.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Far behind, but close laterally and moving closer.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally and laterally. TTC calculation would need more future data to be reliable due to the negative longitudinal distance and positive longitudinal velocity.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3519.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Far behind and slightly to the right, moving closer laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally and laterally. TTC calculation would need more future data to be reliable due to the negative longitudinal distance and positive longitudinal velocity.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3520.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately far ahead.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3522.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Far ahead and slightly to the left, moving away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally and laterally.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3523.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close behind.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Very high risk of collision as it's very close and approaching from behind.  TTC calculation would need more future data to be reliable due to the near-zero longitudinal distance and positive longitudinal velocity. However, the extremely small distance raises immediate concern.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 3525.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Far behind and to the right.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally and laterally. TTC calculation would need more future data to be reliable due to the negative longitudinal distance and positive longitudinal velocity.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3526.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Far behind and to the right.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally and laterally. TTC calculation would need more future data to be reliable due to the negative longitudinal distance and positive longitudinal velocity.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


- **Obstacle ID: 3527.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Far behind and to the right.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally and laterally. TTC calculation would need more future data to be reliable due to the negative longitudinal distance and positive longitudinal velocity.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3528.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Furthest behind and to the right.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally and laterally. TTC calculation would need more future data to be reliable due to the negative longitudinal distance and positive longitudinal velocity.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
