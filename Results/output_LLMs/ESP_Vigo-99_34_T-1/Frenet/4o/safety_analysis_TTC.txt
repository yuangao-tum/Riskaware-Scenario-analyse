  - **Distance Risk reason:** Position at front with a safe longitudinal distance of 20.68 m and lateral alignment; low risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Moving away, hence minimal risk of collision with a relative velocity of 6.83 m/s.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3522**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Located in front-left, a safe longitudinal distance of 35.43 m and lateral of 1.18 m.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Moving away with longitudinal velocity of 6.76 m/s; reassuring distance offers negligible risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3523**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned directly behind at a critically short distance of -0.1 m. Immediate risk of collision.
  - **Distance safety score:** 0
  - **Time Risk reason:** Immediate collision risk due to lack of buffer; relative velocity indicates approaching the ego car.
  - **Time safety score:** 0
  - **Overall Risk score:** 0

- **Obstacle ID: 3525**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned rear-right, far longitudinal distance of 95.04 m and lateral 23.55 m; not immediate threat.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** Longitudinal velocity 3.23 m/s; allows for a temporal buffer to avoid collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 4
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3526**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned rear-right with 86.18 m longitudinal and 16.56 m lateral distance; minimal risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Relative velocity suggests low risk with 3.89 m/s longitudinal movement.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3527**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Located rear-right, comfortable longitudinal distance of 103.59 m and lateral at 29.73 m.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Low collision risk due to distance and moderate longitudinal velocity of 2.53 m/s.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3528**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned rear-right with a safe longitudinal distance of 111.99 m and lateral 35.2 m; very low collision likelihood.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Very low risk with slow relative velocity of 1.98 m/s longitudinally.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5
