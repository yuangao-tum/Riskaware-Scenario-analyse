### Safety analysis for timestep 14.0 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3515.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is at longitudinal -53.02 m and lateral -13.84 m, indicating it is relatively close behind the ego vehicle and moving toward it. The distance poses a moderate risk of collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal relative velocity is 5.75 m/s. The TTC is calculated as |DTClong| / |Vrel_long| = 53.02 m / 5.75 m/s ≈ 9.23 seconds, which provides a safe time to react.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3518.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at -67.06 m longitudinally and -0.82 m laterally behind the ego vehicle, indicating it is also moving toward the vehicle laterally. There is some distance, but the approach is concerning.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal relative velocity is 6.72 m/s. TTC = 67.06 m / 6.72 m/s ≈ 9.95 seconds, which is manageable.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3519.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: At -77.22 m longitudinally and -8.59 m laterally, this obstacle is farther away but moving toward the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal relative velocity is 4.54 m/s. TTC = 77.22 m / 4.54 m/s ≈ 17.00 seconds; ample time to react.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3520.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is at a longitudinal distance of 20.68 m ahead and laterally at 0.0 m. It is moving away.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal relative velocity is 6.83 m/s, meaning the car is driving safely away from this vehicle. TTC would be negative (not applicable).
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3522.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is 35.43 m ahead and 1.18 m to the left, moving away, which places it in a low risk category.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC is also favorable due to movement away; the relative velocity is 6.76 m/s. Again, a negative TTC indicates no risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3523.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: It is positioned just -0.1 m longitudinally behind the ego vehicle and exactly aligned laterally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk) 
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity of 6.87 m/s indicates a strong likelihood of collision imminently.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3525.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned -95.04 m behind and 23.55 m to the right, making it less concerning but still moving toward the vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: At 3.23 m/s longitudinally, TTC = |DTClong| / |Vrel_long| = 95.04 m / 3.23 m/s ≈ 29.42 seconds, ample time to react.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3526.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Located -86.18 m longitudinally and -16.56 m laterally does not pose immediate threats dynamically.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal velocity of 3.89 m/s gives TTC = 86.18 m / 3.89 m/s ≈ 22.11 seconds.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3527.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: At -103.59 m longitudinally and -29.73 m laterally, this vehicle does not indicate immediate risks.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal velocity is slower at 2.53 m/s, making TTC = 103.59 m / 2.53 m/s ≈ 40.90 seconds; time is not a constraint.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3528.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance of -111.99 m longitudinally and -35.2 m laterally indicates no concern.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal velocity is 1.98 m/s gives TTC = 111.99 m / 1.98 m/s ≈ 56.49 seconds; a comfortable margin.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)
