Safety analysis for timestep 14.0 seconds:
```markdown
### Safety analysis for timestep 14.0 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3515
  - Relative Direction: Rear-right
  - Distance Risk Reason: Both DTClong and DTClat are significantly high, indicating a negligible risk due to the obstacle's rear-right positioning moving away laterally.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
  - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is high and TTClat is infinitely high, indicating a negligible risk due to sufficient time to avoid any conflict.
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
  - Overall Risk Score: 5
