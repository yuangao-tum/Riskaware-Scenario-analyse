Safety analysis for the last timestep (6.4 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 6.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30276.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary and located at a relatively significant distance from the ego vehicle, suggesting minimal risk in terms of MDC.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Since the obstacle has zero velocity, TTC is not a concern.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30277.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Positioned in a different lanelet with moderate velocity but still at a safe distance from the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Moving away at moderate speed; future collision risk is low.
  - Time safety score: 4
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30278.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Located in a separate lanelet; moderate speed and acceleration do not pose an immediate threat.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Moving parallel and not on a collision course, negating TTC concerns.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30279.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Positioned significantly far ahead, and at a different lanelet altogether.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: High velocity yet no immediate intersecting path with ego vehicle.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30280.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: In a distinct lanelet; although close, the opposing movement reduces likelihood of collision.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: No risk due to differing lanelet and motion pattern.
  - Time safety score: 4
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30281.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Close, but current velocity suggests it is clearing away from the ego path.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Fast-moving yet safe in trajectory concerning TTC.
  - Time safety score: 4
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30282.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Moderate distance and differing direction of travel imply low risk for MDC.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: No collision course projected from its path.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30283.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Positioned far; active motion but on a distinct path, leaving less risk for collision.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: TTC indicates no collision trajectory.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30284.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Close in lateral distance but not in ego's exact path.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: The velocity directs it away without presenting a collision risk.
  - Time safety score: 4
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30285.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Stationary near the ego vehicle but separated by lanelet boundaries, implying safety in MDC.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Zero movement decreases probability of dynamic TTC concerns.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30286.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Far and in a separate lanelet; no immediate threat.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Fast-moving but does not intersect with ego vehicle's trajectory.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30288.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Nearby, yet the direction changes minimally intersect.
  - Distance safety score: 3
  - Time Risk reason: The moderate speed means it is overtaking better than converging.
  - Time safety score: 3
  - Overall Risk score: 3
