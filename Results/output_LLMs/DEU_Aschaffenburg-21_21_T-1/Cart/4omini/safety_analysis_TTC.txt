Safety analysis for the last timestep (6.4 seconds):
To evaluate the potential collisions in the provided scenario, we proceed with the following steps:

### 1. Identify Obstacles
The ego vehicle is located in lanelet 322.0, so we will assess the obstacles within the same or nearby lanes where potential interactions could occur:

- **Obstacle 30285.0**: in lanelet 322.0 (same lanelet).
- **Obstacle 30276.0**: in lanelet 316.0 (nearby).
- **Obstacle 30280.0**: in lanelet 316.0 (nearby).
- **Obstacle 30281.0**: in lanelet 321.0 (nearby).
- **Obstacle 30284.0**: in lanelet 315.0 (nearby).
- **Obstacle 30277.0**: in lanelet 315.0 (nearby).
- **Obstacle 30282.0**: in lanelet 1521.0 (further away).
- **Obstacle 30278.0**: in lanelet 324.0 (further away).
- **Obstacle 30279.0**: in lanelet 324.0 (further away).
- **Obstacle 30283.0**: in lanelet 313.0 (further away).
- **Obstacle 30286.0**: in lanelet 324.0 (further away).
- **Obstacle 30288.0**: in lanelet 322.0 (same lanelet).

### 2. Calculating Metrics
For each relevant obstacle, we calculate **Time to Collision (TTC)** and **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**. Note that the calculations will depend on the positions and velocities of the obstacles relative to the ego vehicle.

Let's denote the ego vehicle's position as (p_x, p_y) = (279.1349, 300.5916), its velocity as v_e = 0.117 m/s backwards, and the timestamps (t = 6.4 seconds).

**Relevant Obstacles Analysis:**
1. **Obstacle 30285.0** (same lanelet): stationary.
2. **Obstacle 30288.0** (same lanelet): moving forward with velocity 1.7785 m/s.
3. **Other obstacles in nearby lanelets (irrelevant for collision risk as they are farther or moving away in either direction).**

### Safety Analysis for Timestep 6.4:
#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 30285.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary in the same lanelet.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (not moving).
   - **Time Risk reason**: No relative motion.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (no risk).
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4.

- **Obstacle ID: 30288.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving towards the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (considering relative velocities).
   - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC is low due to the speed of both vehicles.
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (possible collision).
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

### Detailed Understanding:
- The overall safety assessment does not reveal any immediate collisions (0 Risk Score) nor any extreme risks (1 Risk Score). However, the presence of obstacle 30288.0 introduces a significant risk due to its velocity and position relative to the ego vehicle, leading to a score of 2.
- The stationary obstacle 30285.0 poses minimal and controllable risks and indicates that the situation can be managed with appropriate speeds and reactions.

This assessment indicates the necessity for close monitoring, especially of obstacle 30288.0, and the performance of timely maneuvers by the ego vehicle to mitigate risks effectively.
