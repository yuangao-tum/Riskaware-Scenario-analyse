Safety analysis for the last timestep (6.4 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 6.4: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories, dimensions of vehicles, and lanelet geometries aren't provided, I'm making simplified calculations based on Euclidean distances and constant velocity projections.  A more rigorous analysis would require dynamic lanelet information and vehicle motion predictions.  I'm assuming TTC calculations involve both longitudinal and lateral components (TTClong and TTClat), though the exact method for combining them into a single TTC isn't specified, so I'm using a qualitative assessment. I'm also calculating Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) based on the current positions and assuming straight-line motion.

**### Obstacle Analysis:**

- **Obstacle ID: 30276**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet (316) than the ego vehicle (322) with a substantial lateral separation, suggesting moderate risk. MDC is moderately large.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Stationary obstacle, ego vehicle moving slowly. Low risk of collision given the current velocities and directions.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30277**
- Distance Risk reason: In a different lanelet (315).  Moderate lateral distance. MDC suggests some risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Moving at a significant speed, but its trajectory appears to diverge from the ego vehicle's.  Moderate risk due to the speed difference.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30278**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet (324) and far from the ego vehicle, suggesting low risk.  Large MDC.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving but relatively far, posing low risk due to distance and diverging trajectories.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 30279**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet (324) and even farther from the ego vehicle than 30278. Negligible risk. Large MDC.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving, but the large distance and diverging trajectory imply negligible collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30280**
- Distance Risk reason:  In a different lanelet (316), similar to 30276.  Moderate risk due to lateral separation. Moderate MDC.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving with moderate speed, but the diverging trajectory lowers the risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30281**
- Distance Risk reason:  In a neighboring lanelet (321) with a small lateral distance.  Relatively small MDC suggests a higher risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Moving at a relatively high speed. The proximity and speed difference pose a high risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30282**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet and moderately far. Low risk due to the distance.  Moderate MDC.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving, but the distance and trajectory suggest low collision risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 30283**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located in a different lanelet (313) and relatively far. Moderate risk due to the moderate MDC.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving at a high speed, but the trajectory appears to diverge, lowering the risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30284**
- Distance Risk reason:  Similar situation to 30277 in a different lanelet with a moderate lateral distance. Moderate MDC indicating moderate risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Moving at a moderate speed with a diverging trajectory, suggesting moderate risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30285**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located in the same lanelet (322) as the ego vehicle and relatively close. Relatively low MDC indicates a high risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Stationary, which significantly reduces the risk given the ego vehicle's slow speed.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30286**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located far from the ego vehicle in a different lanelet.  Negligible risk due to the large distance. Large MDC.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving but poses negligible risk given its distance and trajectory.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


- **Obstacle ID: 30288**
- Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet (322) as the ego vehicle but behind it.  Moderate MDC suggests moderate risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving slower than the ego vehicle, further reducing the risk. The ego vehicle is moving away from it.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
