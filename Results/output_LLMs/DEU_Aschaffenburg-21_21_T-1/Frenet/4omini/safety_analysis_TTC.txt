### Safety analysis for timestep 6.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30276
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance of 13.65 m indicates moderate space, while the lateral distance of 29.05 m shows significant separation from the ego vehicle. 
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: With a relative velocity of -0.12 m/s longitudinally, collision may occur eventually but the distance allows for emergency maneuvers.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  
- **Obstacle ID**: 30277
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of 9.89 m and lateral distance of 12.66 m indicates a more threatening posture compared to prior obstacles.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: A relative velocity of -0.23 m/s longitudinally indicates a forward movement towards the car. The collision seems feasible with timely action.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30278
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of 27.2 m and lateral distance of 41.67 m provides a safe buffer from this obstacle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Despite a relative velocity of -3.03 m/s longitudinally, the distance helps minimize collision fears.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30279
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of 77.39 m and lateral distance of 44.64 m implies a non-threatening disposition as the distance is substantial.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: With a high relative velocity of -8.4 m/s longitudinally, this means it is moving fast but the distance still allows for no risk of collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30280
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of 13.41 m and lateral distance of 14.03 m indicates moderate proximity.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity shows it is approaching laterally but has increasing position longitudinally, thus manageable.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30281
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinally 0.0 m and laterally 1.91 m indicates immediate danger as they are almost parallel.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Extremely high relative velocity at -8.51 m/s longitudinally indicates a potential collision almost at hand.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30282
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of 17.28 m and lateral distance of 40.64 m appears manageable and safe.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity of -4.37 m/s indicates it is approaching but not urgently enough to cause immediate danger.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30283
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of 10.91 m and lateral distance of -37.75 m indicates it is relatively far away.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The lateral movement at 7.55 m/s suggests an escape from collision risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30284
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of 10.05 m and lateral distance of 27.03 m signifies proximity but not immediate risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative motion suggests it is lifting laterally which results in no immediate collision forecast.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30285
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Very close at a longitudinal distance of 0.24 m means it is directly in front.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The-0.12 m/s longitudinal velocity indicates a risk of colliding soon without action.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30286
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of 111.7 m and lateral distance of 45.15 m offers a safe distance.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: A lateral movement of -7.16 m/s indicates safety from collision by distancing itself.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID**: 30288
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of -8.17 m indicates danger from behind but lacks collision potential physically.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: A relative velocity of 1.66 m/s suggests the obstacle will close space quickly but situationally is in the rear.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)
