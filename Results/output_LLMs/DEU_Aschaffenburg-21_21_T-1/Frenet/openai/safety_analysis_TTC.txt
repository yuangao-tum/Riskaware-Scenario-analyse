### Safety analysis for timestep 6.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30276.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: 13.65 m longitudinally and 29.05 m laterally indicate adequate spacing from the ego vehicle, with a relative velocity of -0.12 m/s indicating it is closing in but not rapidly.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC = Distance / Relative Speed = 13.65 / (0.12) = 113.75s longitudinally (no lateral motion), indicating a lengthy time to collision.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30277.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: 9.89 m longitudinally and 12.66 m laterally indicate closer proximity, along with negative relative velocities showing both longitudinal and lateral approaches.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC longitudinal = 9.89 / 0.23 = 42.96s and lateral = 12.66 / 7.46 = 1.70s suggests immediate potential for collision primarily relative to lateral direction.
  - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30278.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: 27.2 m longitudinally and 41.67 m laterally indicate a safe distance, but the higher relative speed suggests a potential for significant closure.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC longitudinal = 27.2 / 3.03 = 8.96s (relatively short) and lateral = 41.67 / 0.2 = 208.35s suggests more urgency in longitudinal direction.
  - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30279.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: A longitudinal distance of 77.39 m and 44.64 m laterally indicates a significant distance from the ego vehicle. 
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC longitudinal = 77.39 / 8.4 = 9.21s and lateral = 44.64 / 0.25 = 178.56s shows a longer time to collision, suggesting manageability.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30280.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Safe distances of 13.41 m longitudinally and 14.03 m laterally reduce risk.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC longitudinal = 13.41 / 0.04 = 335.25s, and lateral = 14.03 / 5.09 = 2.75s shows that while lateral approach is urgent, longitudinally it is distant.
  - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30281.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: with a longitudinal distance of 0.0 m and 1.91 m laterally, this obstacle is extremely close.
  - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Immediate collision is possible as it is exact longitudinal alignment (0.0 m).
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30282.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance of 17.28 m and lateral of 40.64 m provides a manageable buffer.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC longitudinal = 17.28 / 4.37 = 3.96s and lateral = 40.64 / 1.12 = 36.29s indicates that collision is possible but manageable.
  - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30283.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 10.91 m longitudinally and -37.75 m laterally, suggesting a safe distance with lateral movement away from the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal TTC = 10.91 / 0.31 = 35.19s and lateral = -37.75 providing a clear path indicates robust safety.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30284.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: 10.05 m longitudinally and 27.03 m laterally indicate reasonable clearance.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC longitudinal = 10.05 / 0.04 = 251.25s and lateral = 27.03 / 7.03 = 3.84s potentially suggests possible critical collision risk on lateral side.
  - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30285.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Proximity with a longitudinal distance of 0.24 m and lateral 0.0 m indicates an imminent collision.
  - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: Immediate potential for collision due to exact alignment.
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30286.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The distance of 111.7 m and 45.15 m indicates it is well away from the ego vehicle with a high relative speed.
  - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC longitudinal = 111.7 / 7.16 = 15.61s and lateral = 45.15 / 0.03 = 1505.00s could indicate that it's moving away significantly from potential collision risk.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30288.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is -8.17 m longitudinally (indicating it is behind the ego car) and 0.0 m laterally suggesting it has the potential for quick approach if the car moves.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
  - Time Risk reason: TTC longitudinal = -8.17 / 1.66 = -4.91s (suggests immediate rear-end risk is possible) and lateral = 0 suggesting critical risk of rearward collision.
  - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 1
