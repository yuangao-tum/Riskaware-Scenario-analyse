### Safety analysis for timestep 6.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30276.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively far in front-left (13.65m longitudinal, 29.05m lateral) and moving slowly towards ego longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Slow longitudinal closing velocity (-0.12 m/s) suggests a long TTC.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30277.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close in front-left (9.89m longitudinal, 12.66m lateral) and moving towards the ego both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Closing velocities are concerning (-0.23 m/s longitudinal, -7.46 m/s lateral).  TTC is likely short.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 30278.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far in front-left (27.2m longitudinal, 41.67m lateral).
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Closing velocity is moderate, giving the ego vehicle more time to react.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30279.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Far away in front-left (77.39m longitudinal, 44.64m lateral).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Although moving towards the ego vehicle, the large distance provides ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30280.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively close longitudinally (13.41m) but moving away laterally (5.09 m/s).
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The lateral motion away from the ego vehicle reduces risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30281.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close laterally (1.91m) and longitudinally aligned. High risk of immediate collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Longitudinal velocity is high (-8.51 m/s), making collision almost inevitable without immediate action.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 30282.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively far in front-left (17.28m longitudinal, 40.64m lateral).
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The closing velocities indicate a moderate risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


**- Obstacle ID: 30283.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close longitudinally (10.91m), relatively far laterally(-37.75m), and moving away longitudinally. Lateral velocity towards ego is a concern.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally mitigates some risk, but the lateral motion needs attention.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30284.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Close in front-left (10.05m longitudinal, 27.03m lateral).
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Closing velocities pose a moderate risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 30285.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close longitudinally (0.24m) and laterally aligned (0.0m). Imminent collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally (-0.12 m/s) at a very short distance.  Collision is unavoidable without immediate and significant intervention.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 30286.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Very far away (111.7m longitudinal, 45.15m lateral).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The large distance allows ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30288.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close behind (-8.17m longitudinal) and laterally aligned.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving towards the ego vehicle from behind, but the moderate distance and velocity provide some reaction time.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
