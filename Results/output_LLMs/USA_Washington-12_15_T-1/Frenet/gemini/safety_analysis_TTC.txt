### Safety analysis for timestep 3.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**General Notes:**  TTC calculations assume constant velocity.  Realistically, accelerations will influence TTC, but this simplified approach provides a reasonable first-order approximation.  Lateral movement is also incorporated into the overall risk assessment.

- **Obstacle ID: 30604.0**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Relatively close in both longitudinal (15.25m) and lateral (5.48m) distances, approaching from front-left.
    - Distance safety score: 3
    - Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally at -10.75 m/s poses a significant risk.
    - Time safety score: 2
    - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30605.0**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Safe longitudinal distance (27.13m) but moderately close lateral distance (29.19m).
