Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.0 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories are not provided, I'm making estimations based on current position, velocity, and acceleration.  I'm assuming a constant acceleration model for a short prediction horizon to estimate TTC and MDC.  A more robust analysis would require trajectory predictions.  Also, the "orientation" values seem to be in radians.  I'm interpreting lanelet IDs as general indicators of location but lacking a map, precise lane information is unavailable. This analysis is simplified due to the lack of lane geometry and vehicle dimensions.

**Simplified TTC and MDC Calculation:**

Given the limited information, I'm using a simplified approach:

* **Longitudinal TTC (TTClong):**  `(Obstacle_Longitudinal_Position - Ego_Longitudinal_Position) / (Ego_Longitudinal_Velocity - Obstacle_Longitudinal_Velocity)`
* **Lateral TTC (TTClat):**  `(Obstacle_Lateral_Position - Ego_Lateral_Position) / (Ego_Lateral_Velocity - Obstacle_Lateral_Velocity)`  (Approximated using velocity components based on orientation)
* **MDC:**  Euclidean distance between ego and obstacle at the current timestep. This is a very rough estimate.
