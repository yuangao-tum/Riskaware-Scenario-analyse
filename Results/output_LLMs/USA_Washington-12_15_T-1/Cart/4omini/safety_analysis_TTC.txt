Safety analysis for the last timestep (3.0 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 3.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID:** 30610.0
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is positioned at (-141.1784, -94.4209) which is very close to the ego vehicle's current position (-141.1008, -114.079), leading to a minimal distance (MDC).
   - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle has zero velocity, and the ego vehicle is moving towards it. The relative direction suggests that if the ego vehicle continues, it will likely collide given that there is no escape path.
   - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID:** 30605.0
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is at position (-171.8818, -82.4229), and while not aligned, it has a significant distance from the ego vehicle compared to others.
   - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle's low velocity and direction do not indicate an immediate collision, hence risk remains manageable.
   - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID:** 30606.0
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned at (-144.6725, -104.4758), its proximity creates a moderate risk situation.
   - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** High relative speed of 12.4969 m/s makes it a concern in terms of time to collision now and in the near future.
   - **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID:** 30612.0
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Located at (-148.12, -54.7414), indicates a lateral distance that suggests a minimal risk.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Moving away and no direct threat implies that time to potential collision is far.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID:** 30613.0
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The position of this obstacle (-141.174, -101.9299) indicates it's close but not in direct path.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Moving at very slow speed, avoids collision in the timeframe.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID:** 30607.0
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Quite some distance with orientation -2.7273 and velocity ensures limited interaction.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** High relative speed away from the ego vehicle suggests a significantly manageable scenario.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

7. **Obstacle ID:** 30625.0
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned at (-144.62, -48.5037), maintains a good distance confirming safety.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Also moving away with a moderate velocity, avoiding potential conflict in time.
   - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

### Conclusion:
In summary, there were no obstacles with a risk score indicating immediate collision (0) or extreme risk (1). The analyzed scenarios ranged from medium to low risks, suggesting the ego vehicle is primarily in controllable situations.
