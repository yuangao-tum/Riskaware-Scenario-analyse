Safety analysis for the last timestep (9.8 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 9.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories are not provided, we will estimate TTC and MDC based on current positions, velocities, and headings.  We'll assume a simplified collision box model for both ego and obstacles. We consider a collision imminent if MDC approaches zero and TTC approaches zero simultaneously. We also incorporate the relative direction of motion in our reasoning. A score is given based on an estimation based on these factors since precise calculation is not feasible. It's important to remember that these estimates should be refined with more sophisticated trajectory prediction methods in a real autonomous driving system.

**Calculations and Explanations (Illustrative):**

Let's illustrate with Obstacle 30234. This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and moving significantly faster than the ego vehicle (4.7713 vs 1.2134).  The relative positions suggest a potential rear-end collision scenario.

* **TTC (Estimated):**  Let’s assume a longitudinal distance of 1 meter for demonstration purposes (actual calculation would involve relative positions and velocity difference). If the relative longitudinal velocity is 3.5579 (4.7713 - 1.2134), a rough TTC longitudinal would be 1 / 3.5579 ≈ 0.28 seconds.  A similar approximation can be made for lateral TTC, assuming a small lateral distance and velocity difference.
* **MDC (Estimated):** We need to consider both longitudinal and lateral distances. Given the close proximity and the potential for the following vehicle to close the distance rapidly, MDC would be very low.
