Safety analysis for the last timestep (9.8 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 9.8: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID**: 30227.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The distance to this stationary obstacle is measured at about 19.4 meters, which appears risky since the ego vehicle will be in close proximity due to the trajectory.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC is significantly high since the obstacle is stationary and the ego vehicle is moving towards it. This means that the time to potential impact is high.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

2. **Obstacle ID**: 30228.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: This moving obstacle is 152.28 meters away longitudinally. Its high velocity indicates a potential for conflict, yet at this distance, it still allows for control from the ego.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Given the high speed of the obstacle, the TTC here would be considerably low if the approach continues. Thus, a median collision risk during potential trajectory crosses.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

3. **Obstacle ID**: 30229.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Approximate distance to this obstacle is around 19.3 meters; the stationary nature poses a tangible risk depending on the ego vehicle's trajectory.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Since the obstacle is stationary, TTC does not apply rather high risk of immediate collision could be presumed if the vehicle continues.
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2

4. **Obstacle ID**: 30230.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle seems close at about 10.1 metersâ€”risk is present as it may create a point of conflict.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Being slow-moving and very close may lead to potential collision as the vehicle approaches.
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2

5. **Obstacle ID**: 30231.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: At a distance of around 12.2 meters, this close proximity is indeed precarious for the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC here is very short since both are moving but with a higher speed overlapping the ego's trajectory, hence the risk increases.
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2

6. **Obstacle ID**: 30232.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Around 3.3 meters away, it is extremely close if the ego vehicle continues towards it.
   - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC for this obstacle is immediately concerning, and collision is very likely without immediate intervention.
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1

7. **Obstacle ID**: 30234.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Situated about 2 meters ahead can potentially lead to an immediate collision risk based on speed and alignment.
   - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC is effectively zero considering the motion and close orientation leading straight on convergence.
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1

8. **Obstacle ID**: 30236.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Present at roughly 12.8 meters but trailing behind with a marginal distance means risk is relatively lower.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Slow motion against someone on higher speed reduces collision urgency down the line.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

9. **Obstacle ID**: 30237.0
   - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is about 15.2 meters away, which suggests a manageable distance from immediate threat.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relatively slower velocity aligns with safer outcomes, thus indicating a low risk of immediate collision.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4
