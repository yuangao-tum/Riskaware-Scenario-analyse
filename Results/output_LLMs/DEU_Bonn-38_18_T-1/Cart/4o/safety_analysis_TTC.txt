Safety analysis for the last timestep (9.8 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 9.8: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30227**
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** The obstacle is approximately 19.44 meters away laterally and 0.89 meters longitudinally. The orientation and position differ significantly from the ego vehicle's path.
   - **Distance Safety Score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason:** With its negligible velocity, TTC is quite high, indicating very low risk for immediate collision.
   - **Time Safety Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 4 (Low Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30228**
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** This obstacle is significantly distant at approximately 158.88 meters, not in the ego vehicle's direct path.
   - **Distance Safety Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason:** High velocity but on a divergent path, TTC is sufficiently large.
   - **Time Safety Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30229**
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** Positioned about 12.92 meters north of the ego vehicle's position, not in the lane or trajectory path.
   - **Distance Safety Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason:** Stationary with an orientation away from the ego's trajectory.
   - **Time Safety Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 30230**
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** Located approximately 25.96 meters away, laterally oriented away from the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance Safety Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason:** Very low velocity and acceleration minimize collision probability.
   - **Time Safety Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 30231**
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** Positioned around 35.35 meters away, moving slowly and on a divergent path.
   - **Distance Safety Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason:** Low velocity and opposite trajectory lessen risk.
   - **Time Safety Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID: 30232**
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** Proximate but laterally positioned about 3.3 meters without conflicting trajectory.
   - **Distance Safety Score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason:** Stationary, with an orientation not interfering with the trajectory.
   - **Time Safety Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 4 (Low Risk)

7. **Obstacle ID: 30234**
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** Located only 5.63 meters from the ego position. However, it's traveling in a slightly divergent trajectory, minimizing immediate intersection.
   - **Distance Safety Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason:** Vehicle velocity is approaching moderate risk levels with positive acceleration.
   - **Time Safety Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

8. **Obstacle ID: 30236**
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** Approximately 19.49 meters away and not on a collision path.
   - **Distance Safety Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason:** Very low velocity, no longitudinal or lateral threat to the ego vehicle.
   - **Time Safety Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

9. **Obstacle ID: 30237**
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** Located at about 40.98 meters, trajectory not intersecting with the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance Safety Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason:** Despite negative acceleration, movement trajectory is not leading towards the ego vehicle.
   - **Time Safety Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
