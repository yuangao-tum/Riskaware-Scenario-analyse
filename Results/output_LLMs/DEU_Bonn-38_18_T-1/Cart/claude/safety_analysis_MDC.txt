Safety analysis for the last timestep (9.8 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario for potential collisions:

### Safety Analysis:

1. **Ego Vehicle (30233.0)**:
- Initial position: (-192.9112, 128.9775)
- Initial velocity: 13.2816
- Located in lanelet 353.0

2. **Key Obstacles Analysis**:

**Obstacle 30234.0**:
- Distance Risk Reason: Traveling in same lanelet (353.0) with decreasing separation
- Distance Safety Score: 4 (Low risk - maintaining safe distance >15m)
- Time Risk Reason: Similar velocity and direction, but sufficient spacing
- Time Safety Score: 4 (Low risk - TTC >10s)
- Overall Risk Score: 4

**Obstacle 30236.0**:
- Distance Risk Reason: In adjacent lanelet (354.0), similar trajectory
- Distance Safety Score: 3 (Medium risk due to parallel movement)
- Time Risk Reason: Similar velocity and direction
- Time Safety Score: 4 (Low risk - TTC >8s)
- Overall Risk Score: 3

**Obstacle 30232.0**:
- Distance Risk Reason: In same lanelet (354.0) but decelerating
- Distance Safety Score: 4 (Low risk - maintaining safe distance)
- Time Risk Reason: Significant velocity difference but decelerating
- Time Safety Score: 3 (Medium risk)
- Overall Risk Score: 3

Other obstacles are either in different lanelets or moving away from ego vehicle's path, presenting minimal risk.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

### Key Findings:
1. No immediate collision risks identified
2. Primary attention needed for obstacles 30234.0 and 30236.0 due to shared/adjacent lanelet
3. Most obstacles maintain safe distances and have manageable TTCs
4. Ego vehicle's deceleration helps maintain safe distances
5. Overall scenario shows controlled traffic flow with adequate safety margins

The scenario demonstrates normal traffic conditions with no immediate collision risks or extreme hazards. All observed interactions maintain acceptable safety margins.
