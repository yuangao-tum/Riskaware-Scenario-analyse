Safety analysis for timestep 9.8 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 9.8 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30227
- **Relative Direction:** Front-right
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Longitudinal distance (0.36) is very close, indicating an extreme risk, whereas the lateral distance (17.17) is significantly safe. The risk arises from the obstacle approaching from the front-right.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 1  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 4
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 2.5 (rounded to 3)

- **Time Risk Reason:** Longitudinal time (0.3) is quite short, indicating an extreme risk of collision, while the lateral time (175645.16) is effectively safe. This leads to a high likelihood of collision from the front-right.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 1
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 5
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 3.0 (rounded to 3)

- **Overall Risk Score:** 3

- **Time Risk Reason:** Both longitudinal (0.0) and lateral (10865.77) indicate a critical risk, thus likely resulting in a collision.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 0
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 5
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 2.5 (rounded to 3)

- **Overall Risk Score:** 3 

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30231
- **Relative Direction:** Right
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Identical to Obstacle 30230 with same risk profile: immediate longitudinal risk (0.0) but a safe lateral distance.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 0  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 5
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 2.5 (rounded to 3)

- **Time Risk Reason:** Similarly, exact longitudinal alignment indicates a high likelihood of collision, with safe lateral time.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 0
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 5
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 2.5 (rounded to 3)

- **Overall Risk Score:** 3 

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30232
- **Relative Direction:** Right

- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 0  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 5
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 2.5 (rounded to 3)

- **Time Risk Reason:** Similar to others, significant longitudinal threat exists with no lateral movement.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 0
- **Lateral Time Safety Score:** 5
- **Overall Time Safety Score:** 2.5 (rounded to 3)

- **Overall Risk Score:** 3 

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30234
- **Relative Direction:** Collision
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Both longitudinal and lateral distances (0.0) confirm exact position leading to a collision.
- **Longitudinal Distance Safety Score:** 0  
- **Lateral Distance Safety Score:** 0
- **Overall Distance Safety Score:** 0 

- **Time Risk Reason:** Both times (0.0) are directly indicating an imminent collision.
- **Longitudinal Time Safety Score:** 0
