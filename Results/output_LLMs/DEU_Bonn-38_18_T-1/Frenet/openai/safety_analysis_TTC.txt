### Safety analysis for timestep 9.8: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30227.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 0.36 m (very close), and the lateral distance is -17.17 m (to the right). The obstacle is approaching the ego car both longitudinally and laterally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinally approaching at -1.21 m/s means collision is imminent, leading to a very short TTC.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30228.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is 153.41 m (far away), lateral distance is 3.07 m (near the left). The obstacle is moving away.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Since it is moving away longitudinally and laterally, the TTC is high (not on a collision path).
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30229.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is 1.96 m (very close), lateral distance is -9.85 m (right). Longitudinally approaching at a relative velocity.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC is very low due to the close distance and relative velocity.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30230.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is 0.0 m and lateral distance is -24.52 m. Exact alignment, approaching laterally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving toward the ego car laterally, making TTC nearly zero.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30231.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is 0.0 m and lateral distance is -31.92 m. Exact alignment, approaching laterally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle has an effective TTC of near zero, requiring immediate action.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30232.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is 0.0 m and lateral distance is -1.76 m. Exact alignment and no lateral relative motion.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative motion suggests imminent collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30234.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is 0.0 m and lateral distance is 0.0 m. Exact alignment suggests a direct collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: With an effective relative vehicle speed of 3.56 m/s, immediate action is crucial.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30236.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is -13.02 m (behind) and lateral distance is -1.65 m (to the right). This distance indicates a safe separation.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative motion suggests the obstacle is moving away, allowing a good amount of TTC.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30237.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is 0.0 m and lateral distance is -40.0 m. Close alignment but far enough to adjust.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Despite the lateral distance, the alignment suggests an imminent collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
