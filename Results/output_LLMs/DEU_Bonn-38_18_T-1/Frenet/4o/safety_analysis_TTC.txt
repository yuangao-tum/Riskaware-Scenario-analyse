### Safety analysis for timestep 9.8 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30227.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is very close longitudinally at 0.36 m, while lateral distance (-17.17 m) is not significant for collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Relative longitudinal velocity is -1.21 m/s; since distance is very close, TTC is extremely short.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30228.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is far with a longitudinal distance of 153.41 m moving away, making immediate collision unlikely.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Relatively moving away with TTC extending indefinitely.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30229.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Very close longitudinal distance (1.96 m), but lateral distance (-9.85 m) keeps it from immediate collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Slow relative speed towards ego vehicle (-1.21 m/s) implies some time before potential collision, but distance is a concern.
  - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30230.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Lateral position (-24.52 m) is significant, but low risk due to longitudinal alignment.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Constant velocity with no approach in longitudinal direction implies no significant threat.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30231.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: With lateral distance at -31.92 m, the direct collision is highly unlikely.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Continuous motion with no convergence on ego vehicle path.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30232.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Lateral distance is minimal (-1.76 m) with 0 longitudinal distance; this presents a possible risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Steady speed along longitudinal and lateral directions primarily implies moderate concern.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30234.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Exact collision alignment both longitudinally and laterally (0.0 m); high risk with a need for immediate avoidance.
  - **Distance safety score**: 0 (Collision)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Positive approaching velocity shows a continuing motion collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 0 (Collision)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 0 (Collision)

- **Obstacle ID: 30236.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned rear-right with longitudinal (-13.02 m) and lateral (-1.65 m) distances, indicating a safe alignment.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Moving away from the ego vehicle which further relaxes time risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30237.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Lateral movement (-40 m) that excludes potential risk in current conditions.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Lateral movement away from the trajectory, assuring risk reduction.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
