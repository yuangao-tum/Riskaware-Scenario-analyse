### Safety analysis for timestep 9.8 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30227.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance (0.36 m) indicates a close proximity to the ego car, and lateral distance (-17.17 m) means it is positioned to the right front of the ego vehicle. This results in an extremely close approach.
  - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocity is -1.21 m/s longitudinally, implying that the obstacle is approaching quickly. Given the very close distance, TTC is very low, indicating an imminent collision. 
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30228.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance (153.41 m) indicates the obstacle is far away, with a small lateral distance (3.07 m). The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is moving away at a significant speed (12.73 m/s longitudinally). With this distance, the TTC is very high, thus there is no risk of collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30229.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance (1.96 m) is extremely close, and lateral distance (-9.85 m) indicates it's to the right front. The obstacle is longitudinally approaching at a significant speed.
  - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** With a relative velocity of -1.21 m/s and such close proximity, the TTC is extremely low, indicating an imminent collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30230.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** A longitudinal distance of 0.0 m means it is directly in line with the ego vehicle and positioned 24.52 m laterally to the right.
  - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The overlap in longitudinal space and lateral proximity indicates that any forward movement would lead directly to a collision. 
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30231.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance (0.0 m) signifies it's directly in the lane, with a lateral distance of -31.92 m. This also poses an immediate risk of collision.
  - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Similar to the previous obstacle, the exact alignment means a collision is imminent.
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30232.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance (0.0 m) indicates exact alignment with the ego vehicle, and a very close lateral distance of -1.76 m, suggesting a severe collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle's relative velocity directly toward the ego vehicle in exactly the same lane indicates that a collision is inevitable.
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30234.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is at 0.0 m longitudinally and laterally, indicating a direct overlap with the ego vehicle's position, thus a collision will occur.
  - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** With a relative velocity of 3.56 m/s, the fact that it is directly aligned evokes an imminent collision scenario.
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30236.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance (-13.02 m) indicates it is behind the ego vehicle, with a slight lateral distance (-1.65 m) suggesting minimal interaction risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocity is -1.14 m/s, leading to a generally manageable situation with enough TTC indicating that there is no risk of collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30237.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance (0.0 m) indicates it is directly aligned with the ego vehicle's position, and lateral distance (-40.0 m) is still considerable lateral clearance.
  - **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocity suggests that while positioned exactly longitudinally, there is no immediate collision risk due to ample lateral distance.
  - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)
