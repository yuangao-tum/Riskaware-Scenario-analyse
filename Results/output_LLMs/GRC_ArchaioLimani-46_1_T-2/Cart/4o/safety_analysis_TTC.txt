Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 0.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is located in a different lanelet (821.0) with significant distance and movement away from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The velocity indicates it is moving fast, however, in a different lanelet, reducing the likelihood of collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 5.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The position and lanelet (164.0) indicate significant lateral and longitudinal distance away from the ego vehicle's path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: High velocity moving away, not aligned with the ego vehicle's trajectory.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 6.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned relatively far but in the same lanelet direction (820.0) at a stationary state.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Stationary status with no velocity indicates no immediate threat.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 7.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in a distant lanelet (817.0) moving away from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Different direction and growing distance minimize collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 8.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in another lanelet (821.0) with compatible but not high-severity angles.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: The moderate velocity and lateral offset correlate with a quickly increasing distance lateral distance.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 9.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Close longitude and lateral distance with the same lanelet path (820.0).
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: At a near-zero velocity, substantial time before possible collision.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 10.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Fixed object in adjacent lanelet (161.0) towards the rear of the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Stationary and rearward significantly decrease collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 11.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Moderate distance in the same lanelet (820.0), different orientation direction.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Very low speed combined with different angular direction minimizes urgency.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 12.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located away in an adjacent lanelet (161.0) with marginal movement.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity and opposing orientation.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 17.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Eclipsing from an opposite lanelet (2816.0); medium lateral distance.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Different path but moderate speed reduces collision potential.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 18.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Close lanelet (820.0) with nearing lateral distance alignments.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Moderate speed with converging trajectory elevates risk but manageable.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 19.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located further away in another lanelet (818.0); not in direct line.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Stationary and non-aligned orientation mitigates risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 21.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Relative safe distance within same lanelet (161.0).
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Exerting higher speed moving into opposite vector.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 23.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Moderate lateral distance, in the same trajectory (820.0).
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Moderate speed declining in movement direction.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 24.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Regarded as forward moving with increasing deviation (820.0).
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Moderate deceleration away and lateral spread off lane path.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Summary in JSON Format:
