Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving significantly faster (21.401) compared to the ego vehicle (2.1123). Given the positions, the distance is considerable but closing quickly.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk - things are close, and the speed disparity suggests immediate attention is needed)
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC is short due to the high speed of the obstacle towards the ego vehicle. Immediate avoidance maneuvers are necessary.
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk - small TTC indicates a high potential for collision)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2

2. **Obstacle ID: 5**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located well away from the ego vehicle. Speed discrepancy is high. Not on a collision course.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk - the distance is acceptable)
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC indicates that there’s ample time before any potential collision could happen.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk - positive time indicates no imminent risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 10**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: stationary, but located in the same lanelet; distance is good enough.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk - the vehicle is stationary in the lanelet, with distance allowing control)
   - **Time Risk reason**: No collision expected as the obstacle has no velocity.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk - stationary)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

4. **Obstacle ID: 12**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Somewhat near in the same lanelet, but relatively stationary. Safe distance monitored.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk - enough distance to maneuver)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Minimal movement (low velocity) presents no real risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk - not a threat)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

5. **Obstacle ID: 21**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: It’s moving, but slower than the ego vehicle; however, it’s incorrectly oriented.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk - distance allows for safety)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Given that this obstacle moves slowly, there is time before any potential issue.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk - indicates time sufficient for any maneuvers)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

6. **Obstacle ID: 23**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Speed and position indicate it may encroach in the future but currently at a low trajectory of impact.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk - moderate spatial proximity)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Potentially closing but time to react still is present.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk - manage with attention)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
``` 

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the potential collisions in this scenario, the only high-risk interactions with obstacles exist with those showing immediate approaches. However, in terms of collision and extreme risk threats, none seriously require urgent follow-up actions. All other identified obstacles present manageable risks with effective monitoring and contextual awareness, leading to a general safe situation for the ego vehicle at this time marker.
