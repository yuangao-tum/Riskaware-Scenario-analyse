Safety analysis for the last timestep (5.3 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

Since precise trajectories and dimensions of vehicles aren't provided,  I'm making some assumptions for this analysis.  I will primarily use Euclidean distance as a proxy for both MDC and a simplified TTC based on current velocities and positions.  A more rigorous analysis would require detailed trajectory predictions, vehicle dimensions, and a more sophisticated collision detection model.

**Simplified TTC and MDC Calculation:**
* **Distance to Collision (DTC):**  Calculated as the Euclidean distance between the ego vehicle and the obstacle.
* **Time to Collision (TTC):**  Approximated as DTC divided by the relative velocity between the ego vehicle and the obstacle. If velocities are such that they are not moving towards each other (closing velocity is negative or zero), TTC is considered infinite (or a very large number for practical purposes).

**Lanelet Considerations:** Obstacles in different lanelets are assumed to have a lower risk of collision unless their trajectories intersect with the ego vehicle's lanelet or planned trajectory.
