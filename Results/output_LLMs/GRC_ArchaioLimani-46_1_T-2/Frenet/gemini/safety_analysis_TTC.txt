### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Methodology:**

* **TTC Calculation:** TTC is calculated as DTC / Vrel.  If Vrel is positive (moving away), TTC is considered infinite, implying no collision risk in that direction. If Vrel is zero, TTC is also infinite if DTC is non-zero. If both DTC and Vrel are zero,  TTC is undefined, but assumed as very high risk because the objects are adjacent and not moving apart. If DTC is very small and Vrel is negative, TTC will be very small and considered extremely high risk.
* **MDC Calculation:**  Since we only have instantaneous velocity and acceleration, we cannot precisely determine MDC. We use the current DTC as a proxy. A more sophisticated approach would involve integrating motion equations over time.
* **Combined Risk:** The overall risk score is determined by the more severe of the distance and time-based risk scores (the lower of the two).

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 0.0**

- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 11.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close (37.95m longitudinal, 11.5m lateral).
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (TTC_long = 37.95m / 2.25m/s ≈ 16.9s) and converging slightly laterally.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 12.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Very close (10.81m longitudinal, 3.12m lateral).
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (TTC_long = 10.81m / 1.92m/s ≈ 5.6s) and nearly no lateral motion.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 17.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close (24.88m longitudinal, 10.75m lateral).

- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 18.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately far (40.89m longitudinal, 20.88m lateral).
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching both longitudinally and laterally. TTC_long = 40.89 / 2.72 ≈ 15s. Lateral motion needs more careful monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 19.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Close (23.08m longitudinal, 20.06m lateral).
- Distance safety score: 2

- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 21.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close longitudinally (-0.09m indicates slightly behind) and directly behind (0.0m lateral). Essentially touching.
- Distance safety score: 0
