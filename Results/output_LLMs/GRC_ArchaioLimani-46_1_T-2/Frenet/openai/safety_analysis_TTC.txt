### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID**: 0.0
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is in the front-right and moving away, with a distance of 59.93m longitudinally and -93.39m laterally (which indicates significant distance). 
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
  - **Time Risk Reason**: The relative velocities suggest it is moving away; thus, TTC is favorable and shows no imminent risk of collision.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID**: 5.0
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Front-left position, 195.38 m longitudinally and 14.84 m laterally, suggests a considerable distance. The obstacle is moving away longitudinally but toward the ego vehicle laterally.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Although it's moving toward the ego vehicle laterally, the longitudinal distance (195.38 m) allows ample time for reactions; thus, limited risk is assessed.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4 

- **Obstacle ID**: 6.0
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Very close longitudinal distance of 33.32 m and negligible lateral distance indicates a close proximity.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 2
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Moving toward the ego vehicle with a relative velocity of -2.11 m/s raises collision concerns longitudinally, leading to relatively short TTC.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 2
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 2

- **Obstacle ID**: 7.0
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: 18.32 m longitudinally and 44.84 m laterally, the opportunity for positive avoidance exists.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 3
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Negative longitudinal relative velocity indicates a reduction of distance, leading to a moderate risk of collision.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID**: 8.0
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: 46.37 m longitudinally and -50.09 m laterally, situated far enough not to pose a collision concern.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Moving away longitudinally reaffirms safety, leading to no imminent risk.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID**: 9.0
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Close longitudinal distance of 35.58 m and lateral distance of -3.95 m places the obstacle within striking distance.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 3
  - **Time Risk Reason**: With both longitudinal and lateral movement toward the ego, it's important to stay alert for collision.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 2
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 2

- **Obstacle ID**: 10.0
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Close proximity with longitudinal 18.19 m and lateral 5.3 m increases the risk.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 2
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Moving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally elevates collision risk.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 1
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 1

- **Obstacle ID**: 11.0
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: 37.95 m longitudinally and -11.5 m laterally still permits decent distance but requires monitoring.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Negative longitudinal velocity with forward motion raises awareness due to imminent approach.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 2
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID**: 12.0
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Shortened distance longitudinally at 10.81 m increases danger factor.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 1
  - **Time Risk Reason**: The relative motion indicates a definitive risk of imminent collision longitudinally.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 0
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 0

- **Obstacle ID**: 17.0
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: At 24.88 m longitudinally and 10.75 m laterally, the situation is concerning.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 2
  - **Time Risk Reason**: The negative velocity indicates an increasing likelihood of colliding with the ego vehicle.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 1
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 1

- **Obstacle ID**: 18.0
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned 40.89 m longitudinally and -20.88 m laterally, adequate distance exists.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
  - **Time Risk Reason**: The negative relative velocity signifies the possibility of collision, alertness is required.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 2
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 2

- **Obstacle ID**: 19.0
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: At 23.08 m longitudinally and 20.06 m laterally, maintaining distance is essential.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Closing distance toward the ego vehicle longitudinally warrants caution.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 2
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID**: 21.0
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Near distance at -0.09 m indicates an imminent concern from behind.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 1
  - **Time Risk Reason**: The vehicle's longitudinal approach means an incipient collision is likely.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 0
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 0

- **Obstacle ID**: 23.0
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Longitudinal distance of 45.4 m and lateral -35.28 m indicates a significant distance providing safety.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Relative movement suggests secondary monitoring rather than immediate concern.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID**: 24.0
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle 50.08 m longitudinal and -50.23 m laterally is well positioned outside collision risk.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
  - **Time Risk Reason**: The motion indicates a safe distance from the ego vehicle movement.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5
