### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 0.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance (59.93 m) is adequate, and the lateral distance (-93.39 m) indicates that the obstacle is moving away significantly.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away longitudinally (4.29 m/s) and laterally (-20.42 m/s), indicating no imminent collision.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 5.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: At 195.38 m longitudinally and 14.84 m laterally, the obstacle poses little risk due to the significant distance in the longitudinal direction.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving towards the ego car laterally (18.13 m/s) but is still far enough away to avoid collision, with a higher longitudinal speed (16.29 m/s) moving away.
  - Time safety score: 4
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 6.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance (33.32 m) is relatively short but manageable; lateral distance indicates proximity but no lateral threat.
  - Distance safety score: 3
  - Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving towards the ego car longitudinally (-2.11 m/s), which means it could pose a medium risk if thereâ€™s no change.
  - Time safety score: 3
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 7.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: At 18.32 m longitudinally, this obstacle is quite close, despite a decent lateral separation (44.84 m).
  - Distance safety score: 3
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinally approaching at a speed of -6.38 m/s indicates a significant risk of collision unless the ego car reacts appropriately.
  - Time safety score: 2
  - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 8.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance (46.37 m) and lateral distance (-50.09 m) indicate a safe separation.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally (2.81 m/s) with lateral -15.72 m/s poses no collision risk.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 9.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance (35.58 m) is moderate, but lateral proximity (-3.95 m) is concerning as it indicates an imminent intersection path.
  - Distance safety score: 3
  - Time Risk reason: The relative speed towards the ego is concerning longitudinally (-2.13 m/s) and laterally (0.04 m/s), suggesting a need for caution.
  - Time safety score: 2
  - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 10.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: The close longitudinal distance (18.19 m) with moderate lateral distance puts this vehicle in a risky position.
  - Distance safety score: 2
  - Time Risk reason: At -2.11 m/s towards the longitudinal direction indicates a continuing risk.
  - Time safety score: 2
  - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 11.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance (37.95 m) is adequate; however, -11.5 m lateral distance being negative indicates a potential risk.
  - Distance safety score: 3
  - Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal approach (-2.25 m/s) could lead to collision if paths intersect.
  - Time safety score: 2
  - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 12.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: 10.81 m longitudinally is too close, with a moderate lateral distance.
  - Distance safety score: 2
  - Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -1.92 m/s puts it in a concerning position.
  - Time safety score: 2
  - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 17.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance (24.88 m) is reasonable, but proximity laterally (10.75 m) increases risk.
  - Distance safety score: 3
  - Time Risk reason: At -12.67 m/s longitudinally indicates very high probability of collision.
  - Time safety score: 1
  - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 18.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance (40.89 m) adds safety, but a lateral approach increases concern.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Approaching with significant relative velocity (-2.72 m/s) longitudinally and lateral motion puts it at high risk.
  - Time safety score: 2
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 19.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Distance (23.08 m longitudinally) is moderately concerning; then the lateral distance is safe.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: The longitudinal approach at -2.11 m/s indicates potential collision.
  - Time safety score: 2
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 21.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Very close distance longitudinally (-0.09 m) indicates immediate danger; lateral distance is 0.0.
  - Distance safety score: 1
  - Time Risk reason: The vehicle is longitudinally encroaching towards the ego car due to the velocity (1.13 m/s).
  - Time safety score: 1
  - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 23.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: A longitudinal distance (45.40 m) provides safety while laterally moving towards the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal approach (-3.69 m/s) with lateral movement puts it at risk.
  - Time safety score: 2
  - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 24.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Longitudinal distance (50.08 m) is safe but lateral approach poses trouble.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal approach (-4.1 m/s) suggests increasing risk.
  - Time safety score: 2
  - Overall Risk score: 3
