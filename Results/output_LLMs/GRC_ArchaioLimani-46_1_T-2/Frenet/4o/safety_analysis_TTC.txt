#### Obstacle ID: 7.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned 18.32 m longitudinally and 44.84 m laterally, mainly moving laterally away.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: A relative velocity of -6.38 m/s highlights risk, but lateral movement mitigates immediate impact.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 8.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: With longitudinal distance of 46.37 m and lateral distance of -50.09 m, moving away.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Moving away in both dimensions reduces temporal risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 9.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: With 35.58 m longitudinal and -3.95 m lateral distance, entering a close path.
- **Distance safety score**: 2
- **Time Risk reason**: Negative longitudinal velocity (-2.13 m/s) indicates a path towards the vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 2
- **Overall Risk score**: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 10.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Only 18.19 m ahead, presenting a risk due to direct alignment.
- **Distance safety score**: 2
- **Time Risk reason**: With a noteworthy relative velocity towards the ego vehicle, time to collision is reduced.
- **Time safety score**: 2
- **Overall Risk score**: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 11.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: At 37.95 m longitudinally and closing in laterally.
- **Distance safety score**: 2
- **Time Risk reason**: Both longitudinal and lateral movement towards the ego vehicle decrease time and space for maneuvering.
- **Time safety score**: 2
- **Overall Risk score**: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 12.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Dangerously close at 10.81 m longitudinally and 3.12 m laterally.
- **Distance safety score**: 1
- **Time Risk reason**: Negative velocity nearing the ego car, indicating urgent intervention required.
- **Time safety score**: 1
- **Overall Risk score**: 1

#### Obstacle ID: 17.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: At 24.88 m longitudinal and 10.75 m lateral, quickly closing the gap.
- **Distance safety score**: 2
- **Time Risk reason**: Rapid relative velocity longitudinally (-12.67 m/s) suggests a critical scenario.
- **Time safety score**: 1
- **Overall Risk score**: 1

#### Obstacle ID: 18.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at 40.89 m longitudinal and -20.88 m laterally with movement towards the vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 2
- **Time Risk reason**: Negative real velocities in both dimensions require timely action.
- **Time safety score**: 2
- **Overall Risk score**: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 19.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioning at 23.08 m longitudinal with no lateral deviation poses a crossing risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 2
- **Time Risk reason**: Longitudinal velocity drawing toward the ego car indicates moderate risk.
- **Time safety score**: 2
- **Overall Risk score**: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 21.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Very close behind at -0.09 m, posing significant danger if not aligned perfectly.
- **Distance safety score**: 0
- **Time Risk reason**: Obstacle following closely with reactivity from the ego vehicle creates extreme immediacy.
- **Time safety score**: 0
- **Overall Risk score**: 0

#### Obstacle ID: 23.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: At 45.4 m longitudinally and shifting laterally towards, generally distant.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocities suggest movement towards but manageable.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 24.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: With longitudinal distance of 50.08 m and lateral distance of -50.23 m, on a far path.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
