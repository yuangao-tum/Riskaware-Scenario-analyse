Safety analysis for the last timestep (14.5 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 14.5 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3511.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Both ego and obstacle are located in lanelet 268.0, but they are stationary or moving at very low speed. The obstacle is relatively close, increasing the potential for lateral collision.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk due to proximity in the same lanelet)
  - Time Risk reason: Since both are nearly stationary, TTC is not immediate, but risk exists due to their positions in the same lanelet.
  - Time safety score: 3 (Moderate Risk considering low relative dynamics)
  - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk due to lane sharing)

- **Obstacle ID: 3512.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: In a different lanelet (595.0) and moving away. Moderate initial proximity based on position, but no immediate threat given the dynamics.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk due to different lanelet and moving)
  - Time Risk reason: High velocity and significant initial distance suggest no immediate TTC concerns.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk given movement metrics)
  - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3513.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: In a different lanelet (1315.0) and has a significant lead. No immediate collinear threat.
  - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk due to distance and lanelet separation)
  - Time Risk reason: Stable differential in velocity and sufficient initial separation.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk due to negligible potential for collision)
  - Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3515.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Located in the same lanelet (268.0) and within close proximity. Slow-moving relative to ego.
  - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk due to the same lanelet positioning)
  - Time Risk reason: Potential TTC present, but manageable due to low relative velocities.
  - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk with adequate management)
  - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3516.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: In a different lanelet (595.0) with a safe initial gap. Movement leads away from conflict.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk due to different trajectory)
  - Time Risk reason: Significant speed differential implies low collision potential.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3517.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Distant and moving in a separate lanelet (1315.0), reducing any immediate collision risks.
  - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk due to separation)
  - Time Risk reason: Velocity and trajectory significantly diverge from ego's path.
  - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3519.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Positioned in the same lanelet (268.0), close in both longitudinal and lateral parameters.
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk due to lanelet sharing and proximity)
  - Time Risk reason: Although velocities vary, stationary nature of obstacles contributes to higher TTC concerns.
  - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk needing prompt attention)
  - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3520.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Positioned in a different lanelet (2861.0), moving quickly, which reduces collision chances.
  - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk owing to separation and motion)
  - Time Risk reason: High velocity and distance further decrease the collision potential.
  - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
  - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
