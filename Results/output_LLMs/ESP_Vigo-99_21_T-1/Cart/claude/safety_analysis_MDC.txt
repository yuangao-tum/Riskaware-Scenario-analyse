Safety analysis for the last timestep (14.5 seconds):
I'll analyze the scenario for potential collisions:

1. First, let's identify key obstacles near the ego vehicle (ID: 3518.0) which is in lanelet 268.0:
- Obstacle 3511.0: In same lanelet 268.0
- Obstacle 3515.0: In same lanelet 268.0
- Obstacle 3516.0: In same lanelet 268.0 initially
- Other obstacles are in different lanelets

2. Detailed Safety Analysis:

For Obstacle 3511.0:
- Distance Risk reason: Very close longitudinal distance, sharing same lanelet
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium risk due to being in same lane but maintaining stable distance)
- Time Risk reason: Low relative velocity, maintaining safe distance
- Time safety score: 4 (Low risk due to controlled movement)
- Overall Risk score: 3

For Obstacle 3515.0:
- Distance Risk reason: Moderate longitudinal separation, same lanelet
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low risk due to sufficient spacing)
- Time Risk reason: Low relative velocity, controlled movement
- Time safety score: 4 (Low risk due to predictable trajectory)
- Overall Risk score: 4

For Obstacle 3516.0:
- Distance Risk reason: Initially in same lanelet, then changes trajectory
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium risk during lane change)
- Time Risk reason: Increasing lateral separation as it changes lanes
- Time safety score: 4 (Low risk due to diverging paths)
- Overall Risk score: 3

3. Other obstacles maintain safe distances in different lanelets with scores of 4-5.

Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Key Findings:
1. No immediate collision risks identified (no scores of 0 or 1)
2. Main attention points are obstacles in same lanelet (3511.0, 3515.0, 3516.0)
3. All other obstacles maintain safe distances and trajectories
4. The ego vehicle maintains stable movement with controlled speed

The scenario shows moderate risk levels but no immediate collision dangers, with good separation distances and controlled velocities between vehicles.
