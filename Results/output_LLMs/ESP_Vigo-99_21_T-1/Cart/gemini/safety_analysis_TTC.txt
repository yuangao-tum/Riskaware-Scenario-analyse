Safety analysis for the last timestep (14.5 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 14.5: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 3511.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Stationary obstacle in the same lanelet (268) and directly ahead of the ego vehicle.  The relative longitudinal distance is small.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Ego vehicle is approaching the stationary obstacle.  TTC is dependent on the ego vehicle's deceleration.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 3512.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (595) and poses no immediate threat. Lateral and longitudinal separations are significant.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Paths do not intersect.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 3513.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (1315) and poses no immediate threat.  Adequate separation distance.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Paths do not intersect.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 3515.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet (268) but slightly ahead of the ego vehicle. Relatively small longitudinal distance.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving slower than the ego vehicle, leading to a potential catch-up situation. The TTC isn't critically low but requires monitoring.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 3516.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (595) and poses no immediate risk.  Sufficient separation.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Trajectories don't intersect.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 3517.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is in a different lanelet (1315) with sufficient separation. No immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: No trajectory intersection foreseen.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 3519.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet (268) and ahead of the ego vehicle. Longitudinal separation is greater than with Obstacle 3515.0.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving slower than ego vehicle, posing a potential catch-up situation that requires monitoring. However, there's enough time and distance for adjustments.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)


**- Obstacle ID: 3520.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (2861), and poses no immediate risk.  Sufficient separation.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  No trajectory conflicts anticipated.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
