Safety analysis for the last timestep (14.5 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 14.5 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

**Obstacle ID: 3511.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary (velocity = 0) and located at (63.5087, -384.3391). The closest approach based on coordinates suggests a safe distance from the ego vehicle. 
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Since the obstacle is stationary, the TTC can be considered effectively infinite in the forward path of the ego vehicle, with no collision anticipated towards the obstacle.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

**Obstacle ID: 3512.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (20.538, -416.0931) with a velocity of 7.255, it is moving laterally across the path of the ego vehicle but is far away in terms of both distance and lanelet separation.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: As it is also moving away from the ego vehicle and is at a significant distance, the TTC indicates minimal risk of a collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

---

**Obstacle ID: 3513.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle at (39.5159, -462.5635) is also moving (velocity of 8.6633) but is relatively distant and has no direct trajectory conflict.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: With a significant distance and potential pathway difference, TTC suggests minimal concern.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

---

**Obstacle ID: 3515.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned close at (58.81, -368.177) with velocity 1.2063, this obstacle is moving slowly but still sufficiently distant from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Given the low speed and current distance, the TTC is adequate enough to avoid any risk of collision.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

---

**Obstacle ID: 3516.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (52.2336, -403.6331) with a speed of 8.2383 indicates it is moving laterally but still distant enough to avoid risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Similar to previous analysis, this obstacle provides no immediate collision risk as the movement relative to the ego vehicle allows for separation.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

---

**Obstacle ID: 3517.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: Situated at (57.2406, -423.5028) and moving at 6.3831 shows it has a trajectory that slightly interferes but is sufficiently distant.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Distance and current speed indicate there is no imminent collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

---

**Obstacle ID: 3519.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle at (56.8755, -359.3623) has a low speed (1.459), but is slightly closer to the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Despite being closer, with relative distance and speed, the time to collision remains manageable for the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

---

**Obstacle ID: 3520.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is also relatively distant at (62.5007, -410.6646) and is moving at a moderate speed of 6.3623.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The trajectory does not pose an immediate risk, allowing sufficient time to react if required.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
