## Safety analysis for timestep 14.5: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 3511**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of 7.67 m is relatively small with an exact lateral alignment, indicating high risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relatively low longitudinal velocity of -0.04 m/s indicates a small time to collision; immediate attention is needed.
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 3512**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned 26.4 m away longitudinally and 48.23 m laterally, moving away laterally decreases collision risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity suggests the obstacle is moving away, thus TTC increases over time.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 3513**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned 76.29 m away longitudinally and 42.74 m laterally with moving away motion reduces risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Larger longitudinal and lateral distances with increasing separation reduce collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 3515**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinally behind by 0.14 m indicates imminent high risk despite the moving away motion.
   - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low relative velocity implies immediate threat; quick action is crucial.
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 3516**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned 23.13 m longitudinally and 14.33 m laterally while moving away decreases risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Obstacle moving away both laterally and longitudinally lowers risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID: 3517**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned 43.61 m longitudinally and 14.97 m laterally with moving away motion.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Separation increases with time reducing risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

7. **Obstacle ID: 3519**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance behind of -9.15 m implies a very high risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Imminent danger due to low separation.
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

8. **Obstacle ID: 3520**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned 32.71 m longitudinally and 6.39 m laterally with motion away mitigates risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Movement suggests increasing separation over time.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3511",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
```

Note: The evaluation concludes that Obstacle 3511 presents an extreme risk due to its proximity and motion towards the ego vehicle. Other obstacles are managing safe distances and exhibiting motions that suggest increasing separation, thus posing negligible risks.
