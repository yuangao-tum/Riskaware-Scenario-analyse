### Safety analysis for timestep 14.5 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 3511.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance of 7.67 m is very close in relation to the ego vehicle. It indicates a high likelihood of imminent collision due to the fact that the obstacle is driving toward the ego car.
  - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Since the relative velocity is longitudinal -0.04 m/s, the TTC can be calculated as 7.67 m / -0.04 m/s = N/A (the system would be in immediate collision). Urgent action is required.
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 3512.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The longitudinal distance of 26.4 m and a lateral distance of -48.23 m indicate that the obstacle is far enough, moving away from the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Since the obstacle is moving away at a velocity of 1.14 m/s longitudinally, the TTC does not pose a risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 3513.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** A longitudinal distance of 76.29 m and a lateral distance of -42.74 m signifies no immediate collision risk as the obstacle is also moving away.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** As it moves away from the ego vehicle at 6.51 m/s longitudinally, there is no immediate threat.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 3515.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** A longitudinal distance of -0.14 m suggests that this obstacle is very close and indicates an imminent collision.
  - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Relative velocity of 1.16 m/s longitudinally means the ego vehicle is about to collide. TTC = -0.14 m / 1.16 m/s = N/A due to immediate collision situation.
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 3516.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** A distance of 23.13 m longitudinally and lateral distance of -14.33 m indicates no critical risk of collision.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is moving away with a relative velocity of 0.93 m/s. TTC is acceptable.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 3517.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance of 43.61 m and lateral distance of -14.97 m show that the obstacle is far enough not to pose immediate threat.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Moving away at a relative velocity of 4.97 m/s indicates no risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 3519.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** A longitudinal distance of -9.15 m denotes an immediate threat from the obstacle coming from behind, indicating likely collision.
  - **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** Rearward approach at a relative speed of 1.41 m/s indicates a very high likelihood of collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 3520.0
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Longitudinal distance of 32.71 m and lateral -6.39 m indicates that this obstacle poses little risk as it moves away.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason:** It is moving away effectively at 4.95 m/s, demonstrating no collision concern.
  - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3511.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

### Findings Summary:
- There were two obstacles classified as Extreme Risk (Obstacle IDs: 3511.0, 3515.0, and 3519.0) which require immediate attention due to the very high likelihood of collision.
- Other obstacles show varying degrees of risk, with most being at negligible or low risk levels, indicating they are safely distanced or moving away from the ego vehicle.
