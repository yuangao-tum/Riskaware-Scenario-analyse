### Safety analysis for timestep 14.5: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 3511.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is 7.67m in front and directly in the path of the ego vehicle (0 lateral distance) with a very low closing velocity.  This represents a dangerous situation.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  The slightly negative longitudinal velocity (-0.04 m/s) suggests the obstacle might be nearly stationary or slightly moving towards the ego vehicle, resulting in a very high TTC if calculated directly. Since a collision is imminent, TTC is practically zero.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 3512.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moving away both longitudinally and laterally.  No immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving away, indicating no collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 3513.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is far away and moving further away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving away, indicating no collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 3515.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is very close behind and approaching. Though the longitudinal velocity is positive (meaning the obstacle is moving faster than the ego vehicle in the same direction), the small distance represents significant risk.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Very small distance with a closing velocity, implying a near-term collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 3516.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moving away both longitudinally and laterally, posing no risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving away, indicating no collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 3517.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moving away both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving away, indicating no collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 3519.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is close behind and approaching.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Closing velocity with relatively small distance signifies high risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2


**- Obstacle ID: 3520.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moving away both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving away, indicating no collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
