### Safety analysis for timestep 14.5 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### - Obstacle ID: 3511.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 7.67 m, which is quite close, indicating that the obstacle is in the same lane/trajectory as the ego vehicle. Given that it is moving toward the ego vehicle, this presents a significant concern.
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity longitudinally is -0.04 m/s (closing towards the ego vehicle). The Time to Collision (TTC) can be calculated as follows: 
  \[ TTC_{long} = \frac{DTClong}{|Vrel_long|} = \frac{7.67 \text{ m}}{0.04 \text{ m/s}} = 191.75 \text{ seconds} \]
  Since the obstacle is retreating slowly, because TTC is very high, the time score remains at a medium risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

#### - Obstacle ID: 3512.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance is 26.4 m while the lateral distance is -48.23 m, indicating the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle and, though presently in the front-right, it poses little risk due to being much further away.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity indicates a movement away, therefore:
  \[ TTC_{long} = \frac{26.4 \text{ m}}{1.14 \text{ m/s}} = 23.16 \text{ seconds} \]
  with the obstacle moving laterally away reducing potential risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### - Obstacle ID: 3513.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: At a longitudinal distance of 76.29 m and lateral distance of -42.74 m, it is significantly safe from a collision perspective as it is moving away.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The distance and relative movement away shows:
  \[ TTC_{long} = \frac{76.29 \text{ m}}{6.51 \text{ m/s}} \approx 11.71 \text{ seconds} \]
  Given the obstacle is moving away, the risk is manageable.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### - Obstacle ID: 3515.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of -0.14 m suggests the obstacle is very close/behind the ego vehicle, indicating a high risk of rear-end collision.
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity longitudinally is 1.16 m/s (coming toward) so:
  \[ TTC_{long} = \frac{0.14 \text{ m}}{1.16 \text{ m/s}} \approx 0.12 \text{ seconds} \]
  This is critical, indicating immediate collision potential.
- **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### - Obstacle ID: 3516.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance is 23.13 m and lateral -14.33 m indicates the obstacle is moving away and beyond a manageable distance.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: 
  \[ TTC_{long} = \frac{23.13 \text{ m}}{0.93 \text{ m/s}} \approx 24.85 \text{ seconds} \]
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### - Obstacle ID: 3517.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: With a longitudinal distance of 43.61 m and lateral distance of -14.97 m, the obstacle is at a reasonable distance away, contributing to lower risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: 
  \[ TTC_{long} = \frac{43.61 \text{ m}}{4.97 \text{ m/s}} \approx 8.76 \text{ seconds} \]
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### - Obstacle ID: 3519.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Longitudinal distance of -9.15 m signals proximity from behind, suggesting an immediate conflict.
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: 
  \[ TTC_{long} = \frac{9.15 \text{ m}}{1.41 \text{ m/s}} \approx 6.49 \text{ seconds} \]
- **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

#### - Obstacle ID: 3520.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The longitudinal distance of 32.71 m with a lateral distance of -6.39 m indicates that the obstacle is safely far back as it is retreating.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: 
  \[ TTC_{long} = \frac{32.71 \text{ m}}{4.95 \text{ m/s}} \approx 6.61 \text{ seconds} \]
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)
