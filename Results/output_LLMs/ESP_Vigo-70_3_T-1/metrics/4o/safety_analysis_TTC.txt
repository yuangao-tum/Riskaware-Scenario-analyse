Safety analysis for timestep 4.0 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.0 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- Obstacle ID: 3391
  - **Distance Risk Reason:** The obstacle is directly to the left with a longitudinal DTC of 0.0, indicating immediate alignment, and a lateral DTC of 14.76. Based on the left direction, lateral distance dominates.
  - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
  - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
  - **Time Risk Reason:** The longitudinal TTC is 0.0, indicating potential immediate collision, while lateral TTC is infinity. 
  - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
  - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Risk Score: 5
