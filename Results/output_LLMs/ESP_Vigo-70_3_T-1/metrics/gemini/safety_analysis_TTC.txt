Safety analysis for timestep 4.0 seconds:
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.0 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3391
- Relative Direction: Left
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0.0, indicating a collision risk longitudinally. DTClat is 14.76, indicating negligible risk laterally. Since the relative direction is Left, the longitudinal distance is not considered.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.0, indicating a collision risk longitudinally. TTClat is Infinity, indicating negligible risk laterally. Since the relative direction is Left, the longitudinal time is not considered.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
- Overall Risk Score: 5
