- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0  
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0 * 0 + 5 * 1 = 0
- Overall Risk Score: 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 0 = 0

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3392
- Relative Direction: Rear-right
- Distance Risk Reason: The longitudinal distance to collision is 12.01, indicating no risk, and the lateral distance is 31.66, indicating a safe situation far away.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0 * 0 + 5 * 0.5 = 5
- Time Risk Reason: The longitudinal time to collision is infinite, meaning no risk longitudinally, while the lateral time to collision is 3.3 indicating a safe distance.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5  
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 4
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0 * 0 + 4 * 0.5 = 4.5
- Overall Risk Score: 0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 4.5 = 4.75 (rounded down to 5)

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3393
- Relative Direction: Rear-right

- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0 * 0 + 4 * 0.5 = 4
- Time Risk Reason: The longitudinal time is 11.87 providing a safe time, and lateral time is 1.58 indicating a closer approach but manageable.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5  
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 3
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0 * 0 + 3 * 0.5 = 2.5
- Overall Risk Score: 0.5 * 4 + 0.5 * 2.5 = 3.25 (rounded down to 3)

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3394

- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0 * 0 + 5 * 0.5 = 5
- Time Risk Reason: The longitudinal time to collision is infinite indicating no longitudinal risk, while the lateral time of 4.99 indicates a manageable situation.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5  
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 4
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0 * 0 + 4 * 0.5 = 4.5
- Overall Risk Score: 0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 4.5 = 4.75 (rounded down to 5)

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3395
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: The longitudinal distance is 0.01 indicating an immediate rear collision, while the lateral distance is 0.0 indicating another immediate risk.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0  
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0 * 0 + 0 * 1 = 0
- Time Risk Reason: Both longitudinal and lateral times are 0.0, also indicating imminent collision.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0  
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0 * 0 + 0 * 1 = 0
- Overall Risk Score: 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 0 = 0
