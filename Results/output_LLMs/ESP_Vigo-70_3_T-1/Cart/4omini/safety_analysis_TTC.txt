Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.0 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3391.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary (velocity = 0.0) and located at (-518.3852, 550.7047), which is relatively close to ego at (-527.856, 537.3188). The distance calculation gives us around 12.9 meters away. Since the ego vehicle is moving very slowly and the obstacle is stationary in its path, the minimal distance puts it into the proximity zone.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC is calculated based on relative velocity, which is approximately 0.5 seconds (accounting for the slow movement of the ego vehicle). Given that the ego vehicle could close the gap quickly due to its slow speed towards a stationary object, this is moderate risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3392.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving at a speed of 9.5968 m/s and positioned at (-561.4476, 521.4588). The ego vehicle at (-527.856, 537.3188) is approximately 36.2 meters away. Although it’s moving fast, the distance is still considerable.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC is approximately 3.77 seconds based on the distance and relative velocity, indicating a manageable risk as it could be mitigated with proper strategy.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3393.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (-546.7188, 535.2246) and moving at 7.6066 m/s. The distance to the ego vehicle is around 11.0 meters. This is a closer range where the relative velocities start making this a noteworthy concern.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The estimated TTC is around 1.44 seconds, which indicates a potential for an intersection path soon, representing a higher risk that requires awareness.
  - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3394.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at (-572.5343, 506.9768), moving at 10.0187 m/s. The distance is about 52.1 meters away from the ego vehicle, creating a fair buffer zone.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: TTC is about 5.2 seconds, indicating a considerable reaction time to respond accordingly. This reinforces that it’s not an immediate threat.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3395.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Close to the ego at (-532.1027, 539.2331) and moving at a speed of 6.4143 m/s. The distance is around 6.4 meters, certainly close enough to consider this a potential interjection scenario.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The TTC is around 0.90 seconds indicating that this is a dangerous interaction where immediate corrective action needed. 
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format: 
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3395.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
```

### Summary of Findings:
- The scenario presents one obstacle with extreme risk, requiring immediate awareness (Obstacle ID 3395.0).
- There are additional obstacles (IDs 3391.0 and 3393.0) that pose medium to high risk, necessitating appropriate reactions to mitigate potential collisions.
- It is crucial to continuously monitor the movement of both the ego vehicle and the surrounding obstacles, initiating avoidance strategies where necessary.
