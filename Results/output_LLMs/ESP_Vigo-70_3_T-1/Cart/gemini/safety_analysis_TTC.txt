Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.0 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3391.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle is in a different lanelet (409.0) than the ego vehicle (2254.0), and its position (-518.3852, 550.7047) suggests it's relatively close.  Further calculations are needed to precisely determine the distance, but the different lanelets and proximity suggest a potential risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary (velocity 0.0), but its proximity and the ego vehicle's movement require further analysis to determine the TTC.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3392.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in lanelet 503.0, while the ego vehicle is in 2254.0.  The obstacle's position (-561.4476, 521.4588) and high velocity (9.5968) indicate it might be moving towards the ego vehicle's general area.  A detailed trajectory analysis is needed to assess the real risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The high velocity of the obstacle and its negative acceleration (-1.6049) suggest it might be slowing down, but its trajectory relative to the ego vehicle must be considered for accurate TTC calculation.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 3393.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in lanelet 503.0, different from the ego vehicle's lanelet (2254.0).  Its position (-546.7188, 535.2246) indicates relative proximity. Detailed trajectory analysis is needed.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity (7.6066) and positive acceleration (1.1605) suggest it's moving and speeding up, potentially towards the ego vehicle's area.  TTC calculation needs more information about trajectories.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3394.0**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle, in lanelet 503.0 (different from the ego vehicle's 2254.0), is located at (-572.5343, 506.9768), which might be a safe distance. However, its high velocity (10.0187) warrants careful consideration.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Similar to 3392.0, this obstacle's high velocity and negative acceleration (-1.0847) make trajectory prediction crucial for TTC.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 3395.0**
- Distance Risk reason:  In lanelet 503.0 (different from ego's 2254.0), its position (-532.1027, 539.2331) suggests proximity to the ego vehicle. Thorough trajectory analysis is needed.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's velocity (6.4143) and positive acceleration (1.8987) imply it's moving towards the ego vehicle's general area, but its trajectory relative to the ego vehicle must be considered to determine TTC.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
