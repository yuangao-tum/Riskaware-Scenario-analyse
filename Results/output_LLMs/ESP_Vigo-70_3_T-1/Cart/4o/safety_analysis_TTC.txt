Safety analysis for the last timestep (4.0 seconds):
### Safety analysis for timestep 4.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 3391
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is stationary and relatively close to the ego vehicle's position at (-518.3852, 550.7047). However, since it is not in the same lanelet and the direction differs significantly, the relative direction indicates minimal interference risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: No velocity or acceleration, implying no expected movement that would reduce time to collision from the lateral or longitudinal aspect.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3392
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in a different lanelet and moving away from the ego vehicle's path, reducing collision probability significantly.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The velocity is high, and the object is accelerating negatively, indicating it is quickly moving further along a non-threatening path. The TTC is not a concern.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3393
- **Distance Risk reason**: It is approaching from behind in a parallel lanelet but not directly interfering with the ego vehicleâ€™s path. Moderate concern due to velocity.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 
- **Time Risk reason**: Although the obstacle has significant velocity, its trajectory does not coincide with the ego vehicle's lane.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 3394
- **Distance Risk reason**: Existing in a different lanelet, moving quickly with a moderate negative acceleration, suggesting minimal interference threat.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: High velocity and decreasing speed direct its path away from potential collision with the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3395
- **Distance Risk reason**: Its proximity is relatively close, and the high velocity with accelerating behavior suggests potential lateral intervention but is still outside immediate collision paths.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Considerable acceleration and direction indicate possible intrusion risk over time if not controlled.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

In summary, none of the obstacles present a significant collision risk at the current evaluation phase. The overall risk scores suggest most obstacles are either moving away or not in a direct collision path under the current trajectory and relative velocities.
