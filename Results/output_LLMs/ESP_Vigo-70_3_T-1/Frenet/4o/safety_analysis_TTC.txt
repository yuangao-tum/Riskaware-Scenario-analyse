### Safety analysis for timestep 4.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3391.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is exactly aligned longitudinally but at a lateral distance of 14.76 m. This distance is significant, reducing the immediate risk of collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: With a very small relative longitudinal velocity of -0.82 m/s and no lateral movement, the time to a collision remains large. TTC is not immediately threatening.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3392.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle with substantial lateral separation (-31.66 m). Longitudinal distance is also significant (-12.01 m).
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: With longitudinal motion away from the ego car and lateral motion at a significant pace towards the ego vehicle, the TTC is not of immediate concern due to large distances in both directions.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3393.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is relatively close behind the ego vehicle (-8.99 m longitudinal) and moving laterally from a significant distance (-11.73 m).
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is closing longitudinally at 0.76 m/s and moving towards the ego vehicle laterally. However, the initial distances give adequate time to react.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3394.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is far behind and laterally (-11.72 m longitudinal and -49.9 m lateral), which indicates very low immediate risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: It's moving away longitudinally and has significant lateral movement, reducing immediate collision risk. TTC for both directions is not critical.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3395.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Extremely close proximity behind at -0.01 m longitudinally and zero lateral distance, indicating an urgent collision scenario.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Approaching at a relative speed of 5.2 m/s with a rapid rate, giving almost no time to take preventive actions.
  - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
