### Safety analysis for timestep 4.0 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 3391.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance is 0.0 m, indicating the obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle, with a lateral distance of 14.76 m, which suggests space to the left. The longitudinal distance is critical as it indicates an immediate potential for collision.
   - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal velocity is -0.82 m/s, meaning it is closing in on the ego vehicle quickly. Hence, the Time to Collision (TTC) calculation would lead to a very short duration until impact.
   - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 3392.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The longitudinal distance is -12.01 m and lateral distance is -31.66 m, indicating that while it is behind and to the right, it is also moving laterally toward the ego vehicle. This introduces a risk of collision as the obstacle is practically within maneuvering space.
   - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The longitudinal velocity is -0.32 m/s, and the lateral velocity is 9.58 m/s, meaning that while it is moving away longitudinally, it can still close in laterally. The rapid lateral closure raises the concern for potential overlap.
   - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 3393.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: A longitudinal distance of -8.99 m and lateral distance of -11.73 m places this obstacle very close behind the ego vehicle, suggesting a high risk of collision from the rear-right.
   - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: With a longitudinal relative velocity of 0.76 m/s and lateral velocity of 7.44 m/s, this obstacle is actively closing the gap laterally and longitudinally, resulting in a significant risk of overtaking or collision.
   - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 3394.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Similar to obstacle 3392.0, it is longitudinally at -11.72 m and laterally at -49.9 m, which indicates it's moving away longitudinally but towards the ego vehicle laterally. Risk remains as it could come into proximity.
   - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal velocity of -1.32 m/s and lateral velocity of 10.01 m/s suggest active movement aiding in the potential for a conflict of paths.
   - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 3395.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is extremely close to the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of -0.01 m and lateral distance of 0.0 m indicating a potential immediate rear-end collision.
   - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal velocity is very high at 5.2 m/s, meaning a rear-end collision is imminent if no evasive action is taken.
   - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3395.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3391.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

### Conclusion:
In this specific scenario, two obstacles present an immediate danger (CollisionObstacle), while two others are categorized as high risk (ExtremeRiskObstacle) based on their relative motion and proximity to the ego vehicle. Urgent action would be necessary to prevent immediate collision events, particularly with obstacles 3391.0 and 3395.0.
