### Safety analysis for timestep 4.0 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**Obstacle ID: 3391.0**  
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is at a longitudinal distance of 0.0 m and a lateral distance of 14.76 m, indicating the obstacle is closely aligned with the ego vehicle's path.  
- Distance safety score: **2** (High Risk)  
- Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal velocity is -0.82 m/s, indicating that the obstacle is stationary in lateral movement but approaching longitudinally. The very small longitudinal distance suggests potential impact should the ego vehicle move forward. TTC = Distance / Velocity = 0.0 / -0.82 = undefined (immediate risk).  
- Time safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)  
- Overall Risk score: **1** (Extreme Risk)

**Obstacle ID: 3392.0**  
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is at a longitudinal distance of -12.01 m and a lateral distance of -31.66 m. It is significantly behind and to the right of the ego vehicle, showing it is moving away longitudinally.  
- Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)  
- Time Risk reason: With a longitudinal relative velocity of -0.32 m/s (moving away) and a lateral velocity of 9.58 m/s (moving towards), it's not a threat to immediate safety.  
- TTC longitudinal = -12.01 / -0.32 = approximately 37.53 seconds; lateral is not on a collision path.  
- Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)  
- Overall Risk score: **4** (Low Risk)

**Obstacle ID: 3393.0**  
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is at a longitudinal distance of -8.99 m and a lateral distance of -11.73 m. It is behind and to the right of the ego vehicle with a relatively close position.  
- Distance safety score: **3** (Medium Risk)  
- Time Risk reason: The direct approach with a longitudinal velocity of 0.76 m/s and lateral velocity of 7.44 m/s indicates a potential for collision in the absence of timely action.  
- TTC longitudinal = -8.99 / 0.76 = approximately 11.84 seconds, with lateral movement also indicating approaching risk; this isn't immediately urgent but requires attention.  
- Time safety score: **3** (Medium Risk)  
- Overall Risk score: **3** (Medium Risk)

**Obstacle ID: 3394.0**  
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is at a longitudinal distance of -11.72 m and a lateral distance of -49.9 m, moving away longitudinally while approaching laterally from the right.  
- Distance safety score: **4** (Low Risk)  
- Time Risk reason: Given a longitudinal velocity of -1.32 m/s and lateral of 10.01 m/s, the obstacle does not present an immediate threat.  
- TTC longitudinal = -11.72 / -1.32 = approximately 8.88 seconds; lateral movement is not on a collision course, thus manageable.  
- Time safety score: **5** (Negligible Risk)  
- Overall Risk score: **4** (Low Risk)

**Obstacle ID: 3395.0**  
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is at longitudinal distance -0.01 m and lateral distance 0.0 m, indicating it is effectively behind the ego vehicle, closely aligned.  
- Distance safety score: **2** (High Risk)  
- Time Risk reason: With longitudinal relative velocity of 5.2 m/s and lateral of 2.23 m/s, this indicates an approaching scenario, but since the ego vehicle is also in motion, it suggests an urgent situation.  
- TTC = -0.01 / 5.2 = about 0.002 seconds. This suggests imminent collision risk.  
- Time safety score: **1** (Extreme Risk)  
- Overall Risk score: **1** (Extreme Risk)
