### Safety analysis for timestep 4.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 3391.0
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Large lateral distance (14.76m) and no longitudinal distance suggests the obstacle is safely to the side.  No lateral relative motion further reduces risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** No longitudinal or lateral relative motion (or very small) indicates no immediate time-based risk.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID:** 3392.0
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Relatively large distances both longitudinally (-12.01m) and laterally (-31.66m) suggest no immediate risk. The obstacle is moving away longitudinally, further decreasing risk. However, the lateral movement towards the ego vehicle needs monitoring.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is moving away longitudinally, resulting in a large positive TTClong.  Lateral motion towards the ego vehicle presents a moderate time-based risk if the lateral velocity remains constant or increases.
- **Time safety score:** 3
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 3393.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Moderately close longitudinal (-8.99m) and lateral (-11.73m) distances pose a potential risk, especially given the obstacle's movement towards the ego vehicle in both directions.
- **Distance safety score:** 3
- **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is approaching both longitudinally and laterally, indicating a moderate time-based risk. Further calculation of TTC would be needed for a more precise assessment, but the provided information suggests some concern.
- **Time safety score:** 3
- **Overall Risk score:** 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 3394.0
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Large distances both longitudinally (-11.72m) and laterally (-49.9m), combined with the longitudinal movement away from the ego vehicle suggest minimal distance-based risk.  Lateral movement towards the ego vehicle requires monitoring, but the large lateral distance mitigates immediate concern.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:**  Moving away longitudinally, resulting in large TTClong. Lateral movement towards ego represents a time-based risk if the lateral velocity increases significantly. 
- **Time safety score:** 3
- **Overall Risk score:** 4


- **Obstacle ID:** 3395.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Extremely close longitudinal distance (-0.01m) indicates imminent collision risk.  Lateral alignment (or lack of information) does not change this immediate danger.
- **Distance safety score:** 0
- **Time Risk reason:**  Approaching rapidly from behind (5.2 m/s), signifying extremely short TTC and immediate risk.
- **Time safety score:** 0
- **Overall Risk score:** 0
