        "OverallRiskScore": "2"
    }
}
```

Scenario: DEU_Nuremberg-6_34_T-1
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Note: Based on the information, there were no obstacles with extreme risk scoring (1 or 2) overall in this analysis except the Obstacle ID 30796.0 scored medium (3) requiring attention.

Scenario: DEU_Hennigsdorf-5_3_T-1
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [
        {
            "ObstacleID": "None",
            "OverallRiskScore": 0
        }
    ],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "338.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
```

The scenario indicates moderate and manageable collision risks with Obstacle ID 338.0 requiring prompt attention and strategic adjustments due to higher relative velocity and trajectory overlap potential.

Scenario: ESP_Barcelona-49_21_T-1
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30784",
        "OverallRiskScore": 1
    }
}
```

Scenario: GRC_NeaSmyrni-31_1_T-12
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
}
```
