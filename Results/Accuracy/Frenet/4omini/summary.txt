    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30228.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

In summary, there are no obstacles with a complete collision risk, but two (30228.0 and 30233.0) present extreme collision risk and should be addressed immediately.

Scenario: DEU_Hanover-38_33_T-1
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {

    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    }
}
``` 

### Conclusion:
In this analysis, only Obstacle ID 30685.0 presents an extreme risk due to proximity and motion towards it, whereas no obstacles present an imminent collision at this timestamp. Overall, the situation seems generally safe with sufficient time to react to potential risks.

        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

### Summary:
- Obstacle 45 poses an immediate collision risk with an overall score of 0 due to its extremely close proximity and high speed convergence.
- Obstacle 61 has a high collision risk, rated as extreme, with an overall score of 1. 
- Additional obstacles range from low to medium risk scores, indicating they are manageable with sufficient reaction time. Tasks should prioritize addressing those with extreme and collision risks immediately.

    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
``` 

In this scenario, we have identified Collision and Extreme Risk obstacles, both of which require immediate attention to avoid potential collisions. The analysis highlights that there are no additional extreme risk (1) obstacles aside from the immediate collision (0) scenario presented.

Scenario: ESP_Barcelona-49_21_T-1
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {

        "ObstacleID": "30786.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    }
}
```
  
In summary, obstacles 30784.0, 30786.0, and 30787.0 have an Overall Risk Score of 0, indicating an immediate collision risk, while obstacle 30789.0 has a Medium Risk score, and obstacle 30785.0 has a Low Risk score.
